# Agent Workflow Guide

## For All Agents

### Starting Your Session
1. Read your context file: `agents/[your-name]-context.md`
2. Check "Recent Changes" section
3. Review "Active Issues" list

### During Work
1. Focus on your specific area only
2. Update your context file if you discover new issues
3. Document any major changes you make

### Ending Your Session
1. Update "Recent Changes" in your context
2. Add new issues to "Active Issues"
3. Update "Current State" if significantly changed
4. Report results back to coordinator

## Context Update Template
```markdown
## Recent Changes
- [Date]: [What was changed/fixed]

## Active Issues
- [NEW] [Issue description]
- [RESOLVED] [Issue that was fixed]
```

## Important Rules
- Don't modify other agents' areas
- Always test your changes
- Keep context updates concise
- Focus on facts, not speculation
