Doosan Robotics strengthens its business competitiveness with innovative DNA...continues growth momentum\\
\\
Doosan Robotics will continue its growth by strengthening its business competitiveness in various fields, including R&D, production, and solutions, based on its innovative DNA.On the 7th, Doosan Robotics announced that it has unveiled a large number of new collaborative robot solutions at its production plant in Suwon, Gyeonggi-do. The new solutions unveiled this time include ▲ group catering solution, ▲ laparoscopic surgery assistance solution, ▲ airport baggage handling solution, ▲ laser welding solutions, and ▲ bin-picking solution.The group catering solution was first introduced in Korea last November in the school cafeteria of a middle school in Seoul, where four collaborative robots perform large-scale cooking work such as making soups and stews, stir-frying, and deep-frying. The introduction of the solution is expected to improve work efficiency and worker safety, as repetitive movements and oil fumes generated during cooking can cause musculoskeletal disorders and burns in workers, and may also have a negative impact on their respiratory system.The laparoscopic surgery assistance solution requires precise movements as the endoscopic camera is mounted on the collaborative robot and moves inside the body. The solution can withstand a load of 3 kg and can be remotely controlled using a joystick. It is expected to be highly utilized as the robot takes over the strenuous task of holding the endoscope camera for a long time, which previously required two to three doctors.The airport baggage handling solution was developed in collaboration with Danish company Cobot Lift and is used to move baggage at airports. Doosan Robotics’ H-series collaborative robots, capable of lifting objects weighing up to 25 kg, can lift up to 70 kg when combined with Cobot Lift's technology. Doosan Robotics recently completed a Proof of Concept (PoC) at Schiphol Airport in the Netherlands.The laser welding solution offers faster welding speeds than before and produces smoother surfaces that require no additional work. It is expected to be in high demand in advanced industries such as aerospace, automotive, and medical equipment due to its high degree of completion of work. In particular, it can be used with a variety of materials and thicknesses without damaging the bonding material due to heat.The bin-picking solution is that picks up the desired parts from a mix of various parts piled up in a box and moves them to a designated location in sequence. With 3D vision technology built in, the collaborative robot can accurately pick up parts itself, pinpointing not only the position and shape of the parts, but also their orientation and degree of inclination.Along with this, Doosan Robotics showcased various collaborative robot solutions, including coffee, frying (chicken), palletizing, and educational kits on the spot.Doosan Robotics also decided to build an automated cell facility on the second floor of its Suwon factory to increase the efficiency and expand the scale of production. The automated cell is a facility where collaborative robots and humans work together to build collaborative robots. Doosan Robotics' collaborative robots are made up of six axes, each of which is called a module. One module requires about 70 bolt fastening operations. After a human prepares the preliminary work, the collaborative robot fastens the bolts.Currently, it takes about 60 minutes to produce one collaborative robot module. With the introduction of the automated cell, production time is decreased to about 37 minutes, improving efficiency by 38%. Doosan Robotics plans to build a total of nine automated cell facilities next year, increasing the production capacity of its Suwon plant to 4,000 units, about doubling from the current 2,200 units.In the future, it plans to incorporate autonomous mobile robots (AMRs) into the automated cells to promote logistics automation. Through this, the company plans to automate the transfer of parts from the material warehouse, transporting and loading modules after assembly to the warehouse, and moving them to the module combining process, with the aim of improving efficiency.In addition, Doosan Robotics has decided to accelerate software innovation. In October, Doosan Robotics launched Dart Suite, a software-centric ecosystem designed to provide a smartphone-like user experience, enabling both developers and users to easily use collaborative robots.Doosan Robotics has decided to incorporate artificial intelligence into its Dart Suite to improve user convenience. Incorporating AI will allow for faster implementation of collaborative robot features while minimizing user intervention. Ultimately, it will also allow the development of next-generation solutions that learn and make decisions on their own. Doosan Robotics is actually developing a GPT-based collaborative robot solution with Microsoft. Recently, it won the CES 2024 Innovation Award (Honoree) for its AI-powered recycling sorting solution, "Oscar the Sorter."Junghoon Ryu, CEO of Doosan Robotics, said, "Doosan Robotics' product development and continuous growth have been possible by the innovative DNA and passion in the hearts of all our executives and employees," and added, "Doosan Robotics aims to dramatically increase productivity and efficiency compared to the past while humans and robots work safely together in the same place."

Doosan Robotics to supply frying solutions exclusively for a large chicken franchise\\
\\
Doosan Robotics has partnered with a major domestic chicken franchise to expand the supply of frying solutions using collaborative robots.On the 16th, Doosan Robotics announced that it signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with Kyochon F&B, which operates Kyochon Chicken, on the 12th at Bundang Doosan Tower in Seongnam, Gyeonggi-do, for the spread of expand chicken robot solutions. The event was attended by Inwon Park, CEO of Doosan Robotics, Junghoon Ryu, Vice Chairman of Kyochon F&B, and Yun Jin-ho, CEO.Under this MOU, Doosan Robotics will supply a collaborative robot frying solution exclusively for Kyochon Chicken recipes, while Kyochon F&B will introduce Doosan Robotics' collaborative robot frying solution to automate its stores. The both companies have decided to increase the adoption rate by actively promoting the effects of the collaborative robot frying solution to existing and new stores, and to create new business models through future collaboration.They plan to install the first unit of Doosan Robotics' collaborative robot frying solution at Kyochon F&B's headquarters in Osan this month and introduce it to stores nationwide in stages.For Kyochon Chicken, to preserve the crispy texture and savory flavor of the chicken, the chicken pieces are first fried, then shaped (removing any excess batter from the chicken pieces), and then fried a second time. With a two-stage frying process, the introduction of collaborative robots is expected not only to improve work efficiency and worker safety, but also to provide uniform taste and quality.Doosan Robotics' collaborative robot frying solution uses six baskets at the same time, and can fry up to 24 chickens per hour for high production volume. In addition, the highly space-efficient cooperative robot is installed at the top of the frying module, eliminating the need to set it up again before opening every day as well as making it easy to change the oil and clean the floor.Additional features include ▲ an intuitive user interface that even beginners can use, ▲ food hygiene safety certification from the US National Sanitation Foundation (NSF) ▲ high waterproof and dustproof rating (IP66), and ▲ a highly responsive after-sales service. Doosan Robotics provides services to stores nationwide 24 hours a day through its collaborative robot specialized contact center, which was opened for the first time in Korea last year.Junghoon Ryu, CEO of Doosan Robotics, said, "With 1,370 chicken restaurants in Korea, Kyochon F&B is an ideal partner for us to provide a stable supply of collaborative robot frying solutions in terms of scale," and added, "We will continue to collaborate with domestic and foreign franchises to supply a variety of customized food and beverage (F&B) solutions beyond frying."Doosan Robotics is making efforts to expand the service robot market by collaborating with various F&B companies, including ▲ frying solution (Robert Chicken) ▲ noodle solution (CJ Foodville) ▲ group catering solution (Ourhome), and ▲ ice cream solution (XYZ).\\

Doosan Robotics strengthens its software capabilities to popularize collaborative robots\\
\\
Doosan Robotics, with its solid foundation in collaborative robot manufacturing, is embarking on the full-scale popularization of collaborative robots by strengthening its software capabilities.On the 10th, Doosan Robotics announced that it has launched Dart Suite, a software platform that allows users to develop and share collaborative robot applications.Dart Suite is a software-centric ecosystem designed to provide a smartphone-like user experience, enabling both developers and users to easily use collaborative robots. Dart Suite consists of five services: ▲ Dart Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for developing collaborative robot applications; ▲ Dart Store for uploading and downloading collaborative robot applications; ▲ Dart Platform responsible for installing applications and operating collaborative robots; and ▲ Dart Forum and Dart Developer, which are community spaces for users and developers.Dart IDE is a toolkit for the development of web service-based software that can run on various mobile devices, and is used to program basic movements and features of collaborative robots. Even novice developers can develop applications by combining pre-built features without coding, reducing the time required for development by up to 80%. Experts can also develop highly productive and efficient collaborative robot applications using features such as component drag-and-drop and visual ing. Application developed can be uploaded directly from Dart IDE to Dart Store.Dart Store is a space similar to a smartphone app store where developers can register their collaborative robot features, such as machine-tending and palletizing, in the form of free and paid applications, and users can download them. Applications developed by developers are registered on Dart Store after going through internal screening and evaluation. The Dart Store service is scheduled to be fully launched at the end of October.The Dart platform is software for downloading features developed in the Dart IDE from Dart Store and applying and executing them on collaborative robots. It features an intuitive interface, fast response rate, and 3D simulation capabilities. The use of collaborative robots is expected to be even more beneficial, as it will allow users to quickly switch between making coffee in the morning and palletizing in the afternoon through Dart Store and Dart platform.Dart Forum and Dart Developer are community spaces where users can post guides, provide samples, download installation files, get advice from external developers, and gather customer feedback for developing collaborative robotics features.Junghoon Ryu, CEO of Doosan Robotics, said, "Doosan Robotics has been focusing on software development as well as hardware since the beginning of the business to build a user-centric collaborative robot ecosystem, and we are delighted to be releasing the result of this effort," and emphasized, "This is an easy, fast, and intuitive platform that allows customers to change the role or movement of collaborative robots according to their needs by simply downloading the application like they would on a smartphone." They also said, "We will lead the construction and dissemination of the collaborative robot value chain foundation by revitalizing the software platform Dart Suite in the future."Doosan Robotics is focusing on technological advancement, with about 40% of its entire workforce being research and development (R&D) personnel. In terms of hardware, it has built the industry's largest lineup and succeeded in developing the industry's highest level of force detection and collision sensitivity with its own technology. In addition to releasing the software platform Dart Suite, it is also developing collaborative robot solutions applied with GPT in collaboration with Microsoft and Doosan Digital Innovation.\\
