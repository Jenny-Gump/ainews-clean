# Monitoring & Performance Context
Updated: 2025-08-02

## Current State
- Web dashboard at localhost:8001 with 6 tabs (Control, Articles, Memory, RSS, Errors, Logs)
- RSS monitoring for 25 sources active
- Memory monitoring active with 9,645 metrics
- Performance metrics collected for RSS+Scrape
- Complete documentation created in docs/monitoring/

## System Status âœ…
- WebSocket connection: stable
- Memory API: working (fixed)
- Errors API: working (27 errors tracked)
- RSS monitoring: 25 sources tracked
- Articles API: 107 articles, search/filtering operational
- Real-time updates: every 5 seconds

## Known Issues
- Pipeline Efficiency shows 0% (needs scrape_successes tracking)
- Duplicate ainews.db in monitoring/ (empty copy)
- Some queries use temp tables (need composite indices)
