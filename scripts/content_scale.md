**The AI Risk Matrix: Evolving AI Safety and Security for Today**\\
![](https://scale.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fsite-assets.plasmic.app%2F10d007d975e619e91a9bf6170f53561a.png&w=1920&q=100)\\

The shift from reactive models to agentic systems fundamentally alters the AI risk landscape, making frameworks that focus only on user intent and model output incomplete. To address this gap, we've evolved the AI Risk Matrix by adding a crucial third dimension: Model Agency. This article breaks down agency into three tiers—Tools, Agents, and Collectives—using concrete examples to illustrate how complex failures can now emerge from the system itself. We argue that this systemic view, which connects model behavior to traditional AppSec vulnerabilities, is essential for building the next generation of safe and reliable AI.\\

**New Benchmarks Envision the Future of AI in Healthcare**\\

A fundamental shift is underway in how AI for healthcare is evaluated. Recent studies from OpenAI, Google, and Microsoft move beyond simple accuracy scores to establish a new standard for measuring an AI's healthcare skills. This post provides an analysis of three distinct evaluation methodologies that redefine what "good" looks like for clinical AI. We explore how OpenAI's HealthBench uses a massive, rubric-based system to measure foundational safety; how Google's AMIE tests the nuanced, "soft skills" of an interactive diagnostic dialogue; and how Microsoft's SDBench validates an agent's ability to make strategic, cost-conscious decisions. By examining these benchmarks and their results, we provide a glance at the future of AI in healthcare.\\

Scale AI is one of the world’s leading suppliers of high-quality foundation model training data. In recent months we’ve seen a marked increase in demand for PhD-level, multimodal reasoning data across a multitude of domains, including math, coding, science, and humanities. Because of the ever-increasing difficulty of such expert-level data, ScaleAI invests in frontier research on quality control (QC) with LLM agents, also known as “autoraters.” \\

The release of the U.S. AI Action Plan is a major step toward solidifying America’s leadership in artificial intelligence. At Scale, we’re proud to support its priorities—from promoting U.S. AI globally, to expanding its use in government, to investing in innovation and infrastructure. Here’s our perspective on what this means for the future of AI.\\

Building truly intelligent and equitable multilingual AI requires a new way to measure cultural reasoning. Scale's new Multilingual Native Reasoning Challenge (MultiNRC) is designed to do just that. Created from scratch by native speakers, this benchmark tests for deep linguistic and cultural understanding beyond simple translation, providing a clear path for the AI community to accelerate progress.\\

**Do AI Tools Slow Down Developers? The Answer Isn't Simple.**\\

A recent viral study from METR challenged a core assumption of the AI era: that AI tools make developers more productive. It found that expert developers were actually 19% slower when using them, even though they felt 20% faster. In this post, we break down the likely reasons for this surprising slowdown and argue the study's focus on expert speed leads us to consider a more profound story: AI's true value may be in empowering a new generation of vibe coders and managers to build things that otherwise would never have existed. Ultimately, the question isn't just whether AI makes us faster. It's about how we measure value in an era where enjoyment, context, and empowerment are becoming just as important as the clock.\\
