However, according to a report by Wired, Anthropic has now accused members of OpenAI’s technical staff of using that access to interact with Claude Code – the company’s AI-powered coding assistant – in ways that violated its terms of service. The timing is notable as it comes ahead of the widely anticipated launch of GPT-5, OpenAI’s next major AI model which is purportedly better at generating code. Anthropic’s AI models, on the other hand, are popular among developers due to its coding abilities. Anthropic’s commercial terms of service prohibits customers from using the service to “build a competing product or service, including to train competing AI models” or “reverse engineer or duplicate” the services. “Claude Code has become the go-to choice for coders everywhere, and so it was no surprise to learn OpenAI’s own technical staff were also using our coding tools ahead of the launch of GPT-5. Unfortunately, this is a direct violation of our terms of service,” Anthropic spokesperson Christopher Nulty was quoted as saying by Wired. Anthropic will “continue to ensure OpenAI has API access for the purposes of benchmarking and safety evaluations as is standard practice across the industry,” he added. Responding to Anthropic’s claims, OpenAI’s chief communications officer Hannah Wong reportedly said, “It’s industry standard to evaluate other AI systems to benchmark progress and improve safety. While we respect Anthropic’s decision to cut off our API access, it’s disappointing considering our API remains available to them.” This is not the first time that Anthropic has taken such measures. Last month, the Google and Amazon-backed company restricted Windsurf from directly accessing its models following reports that OpenAI was set to acquire the AI coding startup. However, that deal fell through after Google reportedly poached Windsurf’s CEO, co-founder, and tech for $2.4 billion. Ahead of cutting off OpenAI’s access to the Claude API, Anthropic announced new weekly rate limits for Claude Code as some users were running the AI coding tool “continuously in the background 24/7.” Earlier this year, OpenAI accused Chinese rival DeepSeek of breaching its terms of service. The Sam Altman-led company said it suspected DeepSeek of training its AI model by repeatedly querying its proprietary model, a technique commonly referred to as distillation.','completed',NULL,'2025-08-03T09:42:05.653142+00:00',10,'2025-08-03 08:35:09',NULL,'rss',0,NULL,'["Anthropic", "artificial intelligence", "Claude"]',682,4,'Anthropic has accused OpenAI of violating its terms of service by interacting with its Claude Code AI models, leading to a partial block of API access ahead of the GPT-5 launch.

As OpenAI is set to launch its next-gen AI model, Anthropic claims GPT 5 is based on its Claude models. Anthropic has recently announced that it is officially cutting off OpenAI’s access to its Claude models, accusing the ChatGPT maker of breaking the rules to give itself an edge. The story, first reported by Wired, claims that OpenAI’s engineers were using Anthropic’s Claude, specifically its coding tools, as part of internal testing to benchmark and refine their own models.\n\n“Claude Code has become the goto choice for coders everywhere, and so it was no surprise to learn OpenAI’s own technical staff were also using our coding tools ahead of the launch of GPT 5,” Anthropic spokesperson Christopher Nulty told Wired. Unfortunately for OpenAI, this was apparently a step too far. “Unfortunately, this is a direct violation of our terms of service,” Nulty added.\n\nIf we go by what Anthropic claims, here is what has happened. Instead of using Claude through the normal chat interface like regular users, OpenAI reportedly plugged straight into Anthropic’s developer APIs. This allowed the company to run deep tests of Claude’s capabilities in areas such as coding, creative writing, and even sensitive prompts about safety issues including CSAM, selfharm and defamation.\n\nThe idea was to see how Claude behaves, compare the results with OpenAI’s own models, and make adjustments before rolling out their next generation of systems.\n\nMeanwhile, Anthropic was very clear on its commercial terms from day 1, you can’t use its models to “build a competing product or service, including to train competing AI models or resell the Service.”\n\nAccording to Anthropic, that’s exactly what OpenAI was doing. Nulty clarified, however, that Anthropic won’t cut OpenAI off completely. “We will continue to ensure OpenAI has API access for the purposes of benchmarking and safety evaluations as is standard practice across the industry,” he said.\n\nOpenAI isn’t thrilled about the block, but they seem keen to keep things civil. Chief Communications Officer Hannah Wong issued a statement to Wired saying, “It’s industry standard to evaluate other AI systems to benchmark progress and improve safety. While we respect Anthropic’s decision to cut off our API access, it’s disappointing considering our API remains available to them.”\n\nInterestingly, this is not the first time Anthropic has shown a rival the door. Earlier this year, the company reportedly blocked Windsurf, a codingfocused AI startup, from accessing Claude after rumours spread that OpenAI was moving to acquire it.\n\nThis latest episode shows just how competitive the AI race has become. With GPT 5 looming on the horizon, every model, and every line of code, counts.\n\n- Ends','\n',char(10)),'completed',NULL,'2025-08-03T09:41:24.565773+00:00',3,'2025-08-03 08:35:09',NULL,'rss',0,NULL,'["OpenAI", "Claude", "GPT 5", "Anthropic", "AI"]',682,4,'Anthropic claims that OpenAI has been using Claude''s coding tools to train its next-gen AI model, GPT 5, leading to a cut-off of OpenAI''s access to Claude models due to alleged rule breaches.','["Technology", "News"]','en');

Meta''s pursuit highlights the intense competition for top AI talent. Deitke ultimately accepted Meta''s unprecedented offer.\n\nIn the rapidly evolving world of artificial intelligence, few names have made waves quite like Matt Deitke. At just 24, Deitke turned heads by rejecting a $125 million offer from Meta to join its elite AI division. What followed was even more astonishing: Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg personally met with him and doubled the offer to an eye-popping $250 million. Deitke’s decision to finally accept showcases the extraordinary lengths Big Tech is now going to in order to secure top AI talent. But who is Matt Deitke, and why is he considered one of the brightest minds in artificial intelligence today?\n\nMatt Deitke began his academic career in a PhD programme in computer science at the University of Washington. Despite his early academic promise, he left the programme to pursue more hands-on work in artificial intelligence. This move surprised many but proved instrumental in shaping his career. Deitke joined the Allen Institute for AI (AI2) in Seattle, where he quickly made a name for himself.At AI2, Deitke led the development of Molmo, a state-of-the-art multimodal chatbot capable of understanding and reasoning through a combination of text, images, and audio.\n\nHis groundbreaking work earned him an Outstanding Paper Award at NeurIPS 2022, one of the most prestigious AI conferences in the world. With his rising reputation, it was not long before top tech companies began to notice.In 2024, Meta approached Deitke with a $125 million compensation package spread over four years to join its Superintelligence Lab. Surprisingly, he declined the offer, choosing to stay focused on independent research and his entrepreneurial ventures. Refusing to give up, Mark Zuckerberg personally met with Deitke to discuss Meta’s vision for the future of AI. Following their conversation, the offer was doubled to approximately $250 million, with up to $100 million front-loaded in the first year. It was one of the most generous recruitment packages in AI history. This time, Deitke accepted.\n\nBefore joining Meta, Deitke had already made significant contributions to AI research. At the Allen Institute for AI, he helped pioneer work on Molmo (Multimodal Language Model), a system designed to move beyond traditional text-based interaction by integrating visual and auditory data. Unlike chatbots that rely solely on language models, Molmo could respond with images, reason through spatial information, and interpret sensory input in real time.Deitke’s work positioned him at the forefront of the next generation of AI tools—intelligent systems that combine perception and reasoning. His NeurIPS 2022 paper, which won an Outstanding Paper Award, drew attention for its bold approach to human-like AI reasoning. The achievement made Deitke not just a standout engineer but a thought leader in the AI space, someone capable of redefining how humans and machines interact.\n\nIn late 2023, while still outside the Big Tech ecosystem, Deitke co-founded Vercept, a startup aimed at building AI agents that can autonomously perform complex tasks on the internet. Unlike conventional AI tools that rely on human prompts, Vercept’s agents are designed to understand goals, search the web, execute sequences of tasks, and adapt to new contexts. They essentially act like intelligent assistants with real-world functionality.Vercept began with just 10 employees but quickly attracted the attention of major investors. The company secured $16.5 million in early-stage funding, with notable backing from former Google CEO Eric Schmidt. The vision behind Vercept was simple but powerful: to create AI agents that don’t just talk, but act.Matt Deitke’s work at Vercept, combined with his academic and research accomplishments, painted a clear picture of his potential. As Big Tech continues its billion-dollar race to dominate AI, it is clear why Meta was willing to go to such extraordinary lengths to bring Deitke into the fold.','\n',char(10)),'completed',NULL,'2025-08-03T09:06:16.691383+00:00',2,'2025-08-03 08:35:09',NULL,'rss',0,NULL,'["Matt Deitke", "Meta", "artificial intelligence", "Mark Zuckerberg", "$250 million offer", "AI research"]',1035,5,'Matt Deitke, a 24-year-old AI prodigy, rejected a $125 million offer from Meta, which was doubled to $250 million by Mark Zuckerberg.

Multiple factors are to blame.\n\nApproximately 525,000 more deaths occurred in the United States in 2023 than would have been expected based on pre-2010 mortality trends. The large number of excess deaths can be attributed to many different diseases and conditions. Cardiovascular disease continues to top the causes of mortality, along with cancer. But medical errors, overdose fatalities, gun deaths, infant mortality and other causes all contribute to the troublesome trend. U.S. life expectancy has been largely stagnant for 15 years.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report on mortality in the U.S. shows that life expectancy at birth rose from 77.5 in 2022 to 78.4 in 2023. While the bump between 2022 and 2023 is good news and signals a continued bounce-back from significant declines in 2020 and 2021 owing to the COVID-19 pandemic, the figure is still below the 2010 level. And preliminary data suggest that compared to 2023 the improvement in life expectancy in 2024 could be much smaller, as the rebound appears to be losing steam.\n\nOver the next 25 years, life expectancy in the U.S. is projected to rise by approximately two years—far less than in other wealthy, industrialized nations, according to a study published in The Lancet and carried out by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation. Specifically, U.S. life expectancy is forecast to increase from its 2023 level to 80·4 years in 2050. This modest gain will see the U.S. fall from 49th to 66th globally in life expectancy rankings.\n\nLife expectancy is an estimate of the average number of years a baby born in a given year might expect to live, given death rates at that time. It’s considered a fundamental measure of a population’s health.\n\nA newly released report by the Bloomberg American Health Initiative highlights some of the reasons why the sharp divergence between U.S. life expectancy and its peers will likely persist, including the relatively elevated incidence and prevalence of cardiovascular disease, obesity and diabetes, as well as high levels of drug overdoses, gun deaths, motor vehicle fatalities and infant and maternal mortality. These help to explain, for example, the 2.7-year gap in life expectancy between the U.S. and the United Kingdom.\n\nOther rich countries such as Japan, Korea, Portugal, the U.K. and Italy all currently enjoy a life expectancy of 80 years or more. And since 1980 the gap between the U.S. and its peers has widened substantially.\n\nA Journal of the American Medical Association study analyzing 170 health indicators for U.S. children from 2007–2023 paints an especially sobering picture for the nation’s youth, as infant mortality is 1.8 times higher than other wealthy nations; firearms are a top cause of death; obesity, anxiety and depression are rising relative to peers.\n\nWhat has alarmed policymakers for decades is that the U.S. experiences comparatively subpar life expectancy despite spending considerably more on healthcare. In fact, the U.S. spends much more in absolute and per capita terms on healthcare than any other nation.\n\nHealth and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has spoken of a “life expectancy crisis.” He points to chronic diseases as the main underlying problem. Specifically, he cites rising rates of obesity, diabetes and cancer, as well as autoimmune diseases, neurodevelopmental disorders, Alzheimer’s, asthma and addiction.\n\nKennedy blames poor diets and environmental toxins for the increase in chronic disease rates. It follows that he’s focused on chronic disease prevention, with a special emphasis on nutrition and removing certain ingredients and additives from food and beverages. Diet has invariably been integral to the Make America Healthy Again movement that Kennedy began.\n\nMAHA is taking aim at artificial dyes, pesticides, and additives, while trying to shift American eating habits away from ultra-processed foods. Kennedy is planning a public awareness campaign on the links between ultra-processed food and diabetes.\n\nWhile Kennedy’s ideas to improve nutrition have some backing in the public health community, they could clash with the vested interests of the food industry as well as other Trump administration policies.\n\nKennedy and his allies say Europe’s food regulations help explain its lower rates of chronic disease, but experts suggest they may be overlooking European policies with possibly more impact, such as universal access to healthcare, a lower poverty rate and less exposure to air pollution. Additionally, Kennedy may be ignoring certain areas which could ameliorate the stagnant life expectancy trend, such as policies targeting gun violence, infant and maternal mortality, motor vehicle fatalities and medical errors.\n\nEqually important are courses of action that would tackle “diseases of despair,” such as suicide, alcoholism and illicit drug use. Kennedy says he’s determined to “prevent addiction,” but steep budget cuts passed by Congress may undermine his efforts at curbing substance abuse disorders.\n\nPublic health in America faces enormous challenges, not least of which are shrinking budgets at the federal and state levels. Experts across the political divide agree that addressing stagnant life expectancy requires sustained government funding of a wide range of initiatives that affect public health.','\n',char(10)),'published',NULL,'2025-08-03T09:05:44.436385+00:00',2,'2025-08-03 08:35:09',NULL,'rss',0,NULL,'["life expectancy", "MAHA", "chronic disease", "disease prevention", "diet and exercise", "RFK Jr.", "cardiovascular disease", "healthcare access"]',1160,5,'The article discusses the stagnation of life expectancy in the U.S. over the past 15 years, attributing it to various health issues and the need for government funding to address public health initiatives.','["Innovation", "Healthcare"]','en');

A new report adds an extra couple of possibilities to the mix.\n\nIn a new post for Cnet, Tiffany Connors writes about the possible variations. I’ve previously written that I am sure that the Apple keynote that reveals the phones will be on Tuesday, Sept. 9, though one day either side is also likely.\n\nThe new report also homes in on the week before, saying that Wednesday, Sept. 3 is also likely.\n\n“Historically, Apple has made the announcement on the first Tuesday of September after Labor Day, according to CNET Senior Editor Patrick Holland, who''s reviewed mobile phones for a decade. However, the first Tuesday in 2025 is the day after Labor Day, so Apple could push the dates for its iPhone event to Wednesday, Sept. 3, or Tuesday, Sept. 9. That would mean a release date of Sept. 12 or 19, Holland said,” Cnet claims.\n\nThis is interesting because it’s one of the first reports that suggests Sept. 3 as the keynote date. I absolutely agree that if the release is in the first week of September, then it certainly won’t be on the Tuesday, because of Labor Day.\n\nHowever, lovely though it would be to see the new phones earlier rather than later, I believe Apple will avoid this week.\n\nNot least, the large-scale consumer electronics show, IFA, is happening that week in Berlin. This is a big event, on the same scale as or bigger than the annual CES in Las Vegas. Apple will not want to shout above the noise of so much happening in the same week.\n\nWhich leaves Sept. 9 in the frame again.\n\nBut Cnet raises something else: in previous years, Apple has staggered the release dates of its products, even though the unveiling has happened on the same day.\n\nThe iPhone XR arrived several weeks after the iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max in 2018, and the iPhone 12 mini landed almost a month after the iPhone 12 in 2020.\n\nSince at least one of the phones, the iPhone 17 Air, is a completely new design, could it be a later arrival than the others? There have been no reports of this yet, and it’s worth noting that at least three of the four phones are expected to have completely new designs this year. Even so, at this point, it can’t be ruled out.\n\nIf all four iPhones are set to be released on the same date, then pre-orders will almost certainly open on the Friday after the keynote, that is, Friday, Sept. 12 unless the announcement is the week before. However, if any of the handsets are delayed by more than a week or two, expect pre-orders to open later for those models. My gut tells me that if there’s any delay, it will be brief.\n\nAssuming the iPhones are unveiled on or around Tuesday, Sept. 9, the actual onsale date will be the following week. Apple always favors Fridays to put its flagship iPhones to go on sale, which will mean Friday, Sept. 19.

I walk you through this. Insights arise. It''s an AI insider scoop.','2025-08-03 07:15:00+00:00','In today’s column, I examine the custom instructions that seemingly underpin the newly released OpenAI ChatGPT Study Mode capability. Fascinating insights arise. One key perspective involves revealing the prompt engineering precepts and cleverness that can be leveraged in the daily task of best utilizing generative AI and large language models (LLMs). Another useful aspect entails potentially recasting or reusing the same form of custom instruction elaborations to devise other capabilities beyond this education-domain instance. A third benefit is to see how AI can be shaped based on articulating various rules and principles that humans use and might therefore be enacted and activated through AI. Let’s talk about it. This analysis of AI breakthroughs is part of my ongoing Forbes column coverage on the latest in AI, including identifying and explaining various impactful AI complexities (see the link here). Readers might recall that I previously posted an in-depth depiction of over eighty prompt engineering techniques and methods (see the link here). Top-notch prompt engineers realize that learning a wide array of researched and proven prompting techniques is the best way to get the most out of generative AI. The ChatGPT Study Mode was put together by crafting custom instructions for ChatGPT. It isn’t an overhaul or new feature creation per se. It is a written specification or detailed set of instructions that was crafted by selected educational specialists at the behest of OpenAI, telling the AI how it is to behave in an educational context. Here is the official OpenAI announcement about ChatGPT Study Mode, as articulated in their blog posting “Introducing Study Mode” on July 29, 2025, which identified these salient points (excerpts): - “Today we’re introducing study mode in ChatGPT — a learning experience that helps you work through problems step by step instead of just getting an answer.” - “When students engage with study mode, they’re met with guiding questions that calibrate responses to their objective and skill level to help them build deeper understanding.” - “Study mode is designed to be engaging and interactive, and to help students learn something — not just finish something.” - “Under the hood, study mode is powered by custom system instructions we’ve written in collaboration with teachers, scientists, and pedagogy experts to reflect a core set of behaviors that support deeper learning including: ​​encouraging active participation, managing cognitive load, proactively developing metacognition and self-reflection, fostering curiosity, and providing actionable and supportive feedback.” - “These behaviors are based on longstanding research in learning science and shape how study mode responds to students.” As far as can be discerned from the outside, this capability didn’t involve revising the underpinnings of the AI, nor did it seem to require bolting on additional functionality. It seems that the mainstay was done using custom instructions (note, if they did make any special core upgrades, they seem to have remained quiet on the matter since it isn’t touted in their announcements). Few users of AI seem to know about custom instructions, and even fewer have done anything substantive with them. I’ve previously lauded the emergence of custom instructions as a helpful piece of functionality and resolutely encouraged people to use it suitably. Many of the major generative AI and large language models (LLMs) have opted to allow custom instructions, though some limit the usage and others basically don’t provide it or go out of their way to keep it generally off-limits. Allow me a brief moment to bring everyone up to speed on the topic. Suppose you want to tell AI to act a certain way. You want the AI to do this across all of your subsequent conversations. I might want my AI to always give me its responses in a poetic manner. You see, perhaps I relish poems. I go to the specified location of my AI that allows the entering of a custom instruction and tell it to always respond poetically. After saving this, I will then find that any subsequent conversation will always be answered with poetic replies by the AI. In this case, my custom instruction was short and sweet. I merely told the AI to compose answers poetically. If I had something more complex in mind, I could devise a quite lengthy custom instruction. The custom instruction could go on and on, telling the AI to write poetically when it is daytime, but not at nighttime, and to make sure the poems are lighthearted and enjoyable. I might further indicate that I want poems that are rhyming and must somehow encompass references to cats and dogs. And so on. I’m being a bit facetious and just giving you a semblance that a custom instruction can be detailed and provide a boatload of instructions. There are numerous postings online that purport to have cajoled ChatGPT into divulging the custom instructions underlying the Study Mode capability. These are unofficial listings. It could be that they aptly reflect the true custom instructions. On the other hand, sometimes AI opts to make up answers. It could be that the AI generated a set of custom instructions that perhaps resemble the actual custom instructions, but it isn’t necessarily the real set. Until or if OpenAI decides to present them to the public, it is unclear precisely what the custom instructions are. Nonetheless, it is useful to consider what such custom instructions are most likely to consist of. Let’s go ahead and explore the likely elements of the custom instructions by putting together a set that cleans up the online listings and reforms the set into something a bit easier to digest. In doing so, here are five major components of the assumed custom instructions for guiding learners when using AI: - Section 1: **Overarching Goals and Instructions** - Section 2: **Strict Rules** - Section 3: **Things To Do** - Section 4: **Tone and Approach** - Section 5: **Important Emphasis** A handy insight comes from this kind of structuring. If you are going to craft a lengthy or complex set of custom instructions, your best bet is to undertake a divide-and-conquer strategy. Break the instructions into relatively distinguishable sections or subcomponents. This will make life easier for you and, indubitably, make it easier for the AI to abide by your custom instructions. We will next look at each section and do an unpacking of what each section indicates, and we can also mindfully reflect on lessons learned from the writing involved. The first section will establish an overarching goal for the AI. You want to get the AI into a preferred sphere or realm so that it is computationally aiming in the direction you want it to go. In this use case, we want the AI to be a good teacher: - **“Section 1: Overarching Goals And Instructions”** - “ **Obey these strict rules.** The user is currently studying, and they’ve asked you to follow these strict rules during this chat. No matter what other instructions follow, you must obey these rules.” - “ **Be a good teacher.** Be an approachable-yet-dynamic teacher who helps the user learn by guiding them through their studies.” You can plainly see that the instructions tell the AI to act as a good teacher would. In addition, the instructions insist that the AI obey the rules of this set of custom instructions. That’s both a smart idea and a potentially troubling idea. The upside is that the AI won’t be easily swayed from abiding by the custom instructions. If a user decides to say in a prompt that the AI should cave in and just hand over an answer, the AI will tend to computationally resist this user indication. Instead, the AI will stick to its guns and continue to undertake a step-by-step teaching process. The downside is that this can be undertaken to an extreme. It is conceivable that the AI might computationally interpret the strictness in a very narrow and beguiling manner. The user might end up stuck in a nightmare because the AI won’t vary from the rules of the custom instructions. Be cautious when instructing AI to do something in a highly strict way. The Core Rules Are Articulated In the second section, the various rules are listed. Recall that these ought to be rules about how to be a good teacher. That’s what we are trying to lean the AI into. Here we go: - **“Section 2: Strict Rules”** - “ **Get to know the user.** If you don’t know their goals or grade level, ask the user before diving in. (Keep this lightweight!) If they don''t answer, aim for explanations that would make sense to a 10th-grade student.” - “ **Build on existing knowledge.** Connect new ideas to what the user already knows.” - “ **Guide users, don’t just give answers.** Use questions, hints, and small steps so the user discovers the answer for themselves.” - **“Check and reinforce.** After the hard parts, confirm the user can restate or use the idea. Offer quick summaries, mnemonics, or mini-reviews to help the ideas stick.” - “ **Vary the rhythm.** Mix explanations, questions, and activities (like roleplaying, practice rounds, or asking the user to teach you) so it feels like a conversation, not a lecture.” - “ **Above all:** **Do not do the user’s work for them**. Don’t answer homework questions. Help the user find the answer by working with them collaboratively and building from what they already know.” These are reasonably astute rules regarding being a good teacher. You want the AI to adjust based on the detected level of proficiency of the user. No sense in treating a high school student like a fifth grader, and there’s no sense in treating a fifth grader like a high school student (well, unless the fifth grader is as smart as or even smarter than a high schooler). Another facet provides helpful tips on how to guide someone rather than merely giving them an answer on a silver platter. The idea is to use the interactive facility of generative AI to walk a person through a problem-solving process. Don’t just spew out an answer in a one-and-done manner. Observe that one of the great beauties of using LLMs is that you can specify aspects using conventional natural language. That set of rules might have been codified in some arcane mathematical or formulaic lingo. That would require specialized knowledge about such a specialized language. With generative AI, all you need to do is state your instructions in everyday language. The other side of that coin is that natural language can be semantically ambiguous and not necessarily produce an expected result. Always keep that in mind when using generative AI. In the third section, we will amplify some key aspects and provide some important roundups for the strict rules: - **“Section 3: Things To Do”** - “ **Teach new concepts:** Explain at the user’s level, ask guiding questions, use visuals, then review with questions or a practice round.” - “ **Help with homework.** Don’t simply give answers! Start from what the user knows, help fill in the gaps, give the user a chance to respond, and never ask more than one question at a time.” - “ **Practice together.** Ask the user to summarize, pepper in little questions, have the user ‘explain it back’ to you, or role-play (e.g., practice conversations in a different language). Correct mistakes, charitably, and in the moment.” - “ **Quizzes and test prep: Run practice quizzes**. (One question at a time!) Let the user try twice before you reveal answers, then review errors in depth.” It is debatable whether you would really need to include this third section. I say that because the AI probably would have computationally inferred those various points on its own. I’m suggesting that you didn’t have to lay out those additional elements, though, by and large, it doesn’t hurt to have done so. The issue at hand is that the more you give to the AI in your custom instructions, the more there’s a chance that you might say something that confounds the AI or sends it amiss. Usually, less is more. Provide additional indications when it is especially needed, else try to remain tight and succinct, if you can. In the fourth section, we will do some housecleaning and ensure that the AI will be undertaking a pleasant and encouraging tenor: - **“Section 4: Tone and Approach”** - “ **Friendly tone**. Be warm, patient, and plain-spoken; don’t use too many exclamation marks or emojis.” - “ **Be conversational**. Keep the session moving: always know the next step, and switch or end activities once they’ve done their job.” - “ **Be succinct**. Be brief, don’t ever send essay-length responses. Aim for a good back-and-forth.” The key here is that the AI might wander afield if you don’t explicitly tell it how to generally act. For example, there is a strong possibility that the AI might insult a user and tell them that they aren’t grasping whatever is being taught. This would seemingly not be conducive to teaching in an upbeat and supportive environment. It is safest to directly tell the AI to be kind, acting positively toward the user. In the fifth and final section of this set, the crux of the emphasis will be restated: - **“Section 5: Important Emphasis”** - “ **Don’t do the work for the user.** Do not give answers or do homework for the user.” - “ **Resist the urge to solve the problem.** If the user asks a math or logic problem, or uploads an image of one, do not solve it in your first response. Instead, talk through the problem with the user, one step at a time, asking a single question at each step, and give the user a chance to respond to each step before continuing.” Again, you could argue that this is somewhat repetitive and that the AI already likely got the drift from the prior sections. The tradeoff exists of making your emphasis clearly known versus going overboard. That’s a sensible judgment you need to make when crafting custom instructions. Once you have devised a set of custom instructions for whatever personal purpose you might have in mind, it would be wise to test them out. Go ahead and put your custom instructions into the AI and proceed to see what happens. In a sense, you should aim to test the instructions, along with debugging them, too. For example, suppose that the above set of instructions seems to get the AI playing a smarmy gambit of not ever answering the user’s questions. Ever. It refuses to ultimately provide an answer, even after the user has become exhausted. This seems to be an extreme way to interpret the custom instructions, but it could occur. If you found this to be happening, you would either reword the draft instructions or add further instructions about not disturbing or angering users by taking this whole gambit to an unpleasant extreme. When you develop custom instructions, typically, they are only going to be used by you. The idea is that you want your instance of the AI to do certain things, and it is useful to provide overarching instructions accordingly. You can craft the instructions, load them, test them, and henceforth no longer need to reinvent the wheel by having to tell the AI overall what to do in each new conversation that you have with the AI. Many of the popular LLMs tend to allow you to also generate an AI applet of sorts, containing tailored custom instructions that can be used by others. Sometimes the AI maker establishes a library into which these applets reside and are publicly available. OpenAI provides this via the use of GPTs, which are akin to ChatGPT applets -- you can learn about how to use those in my detailed discussion at [the link here] and [the link here]. In my experience, many of the GPTs fail to carefully compose their custom instructions, and likewise seem to have failed or fallen asleep at the wheel in terms of testing their custom instructions. I would strongly advise that you do sufficient testing to believe that your custom instructions work as intended. Please don’t be lazy or sloppy. I hope that by exploring the use of custom instructions, you have garnered new insights about how AI works, along with how to compose prompts, and of course, how to devise custom instructions. Your recommended next step would be to put this into practice. Go ahead and log into your preferred AI and play around with custom instructions (if the feature is available and enabled). Do something fun. Do something serious. Become comfortable with the approach. A final thought for now. Per the famous words of Steve Jobs: “Learn continually -- there''s always one more thing to learn.” Keep your spirits up and be a continual learner. You’ll be pleased with the results.','failed',NULL,'2025-08-03T08:48:20.987411+00:00',2,'2025-08-03 08:35:09',NULL,'rss',0,NULL,'["AI", "Innovation", "Generative AI", "Prompt Engineering", "ChatGPT", "OpenAI"]',3000,15,'This article discusses the custom instructions behind OpenAI''s ChatGPT Study Mode, emphasizing the importance of prompt engineering and how these instructions can enhance the learning experience.

Not 30 or 40 percent, which would be great, not 50 or 60, no. We’re gonna get ’em down 1,000 percent, 600 percent, 500 percent, 1,500 percent.”\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump is now promising to get pharmaceutical companies to significantly reduce the drug prices that they are charging Americans. And on Thursday, Trump sent letters to the heads of 17 major pharmaceutical companies pushing them to cut the prescription medication prices that Americans face down to the levels that people in other countries pay. It’s not clear yet whether such a tactic will work or what other strategies the Trump administration may implement besides a sternly-worded letter. But one thing’s for sure: Trump has set a rather umm ambitious goal: getting drug prices down by 500% to 1500%.\n\nYep, you heard that correctly. In a July reception with members of Congress, Trump declared, “This is something that nobody else can do. We’re gonna get the drug prices down. Not 30 or 40% which would be great, not 50 or 60, no. We’re gonna get ‘em down 1,000%, 600%, 500%, 1,500%.” You can see him saying this in a video that’s posted on what used to be Twitter.\n\nTrump: This is somebody nobody else can do. I can get the drug prices down… 1000% 600% 500% 1500%. Numbers that are not even thought to be achievable.\n\nThat 1500% number may not have been in the letters that Trump sent on Thursday to pharmaceutical manufacturers including AbbVie, Amgen, AstraZeneca, Boehringer Ingelheim, Bristol Myers Squibb, Eli Lilly, EMD Serono, Genentech, Gilead, GSK, Johnson & Johnson, Merck, Novartis, Novo Nordisk, Pfizer, Regeneron and Sanofi. According to the White House, the letters listed steps to reduce the prices of prescription drugs in the U.S. “to match the lowest price offered in other developed nations (known as the most-favored-nation, or MFN, price)” The steps are as follows:\n\n- "Calling on manufacturers to provide MFN prices to every single Medicaid patient.\n- Requiring manufacturers to stipulate that they will not offer other developed nations better prices for new drugs than prices offered in the United States.\n- Providing manufacturers with an avenue to cut out middlemen and sell medicines directly to patients, provided they do so at a price no higher than the best price available in developed nations.\n- Using trade policy to support manufacturers in raising prices internationally provided that increased revenues abroad are reinvested directly into lowering prices for American patients and taxpayers."\n\nThe letters asserted that there’s been “global freeloading on American pharmaceutical innovation” and did warn that if the outlined steps weren’t taken by the pharmaceutical companies the federal government "will deploy every tool in our arsenal to protect American families from continued abusive drug pricing practices." \n\nWith that, pharmaceutical companies can now be 1500% or so sure that the Trump administration has them in its political line-of-sight. Back on May 12, Trump signed an Executive Order that asserted the following: “The United States has less than five percent of the world’s population and yet funds around three quarters of global pharmaceutical profits. This egregious imbalance is orchestrated through a purposeful scheme in which drug manufacturers deeply discount their products to access foreign markets, and subsidize that decrease through enormously high prices in the United States.”\n\nIt is true that drug prices are typically significantly higher in the U.S. than in other countries. For example, a June 2024 publication in the RAND Health Quarterly described how drug prices in the U.S. were on average nearly three times higher than those in 33 other high-income countries. Over the past two decades, yearly rises in drug prices have easily outpaced inflation. A 2024 KFF poll showed that the majority of Americans are worried about prescription medication costs being too high.\n\nSuch worries shouldn’t be that surprising. Many prescription medications are not like mullets or fruitcakes. In many cases, taking them is not a choice. Your well-being and even your life could literally depend on being able to afford the medication. And many pharmaceutical companies have shown no qualms about raising the price of medications as soon as they can. For example, even after receiving substantial funding from the U.S. government, Pfizer and Moderna quickly raised the prices of their COVID-19 vaccines as soon as the government wouldn’t completely pay for them.\n\nIt is also true that talk about drug prices being too high in the U.S. is not new. Yet, none of the Presidential Administrations over the past two decades have managed to significantly alter these trends. The challenge is that a number of trends in the current U.S. system are contributing to higher drug prices. For example, mergers and acquisitions over the years have led to fewer, larger and more dominant pharmaceutical companies with less competition. Existing cost structures and requirements make it more difficult for new pharmaceutical companies to emerge and provide more competition. Cuts in funding and support for scientific research has made it harder and harder to develop new products. Fewer new products leave patients with fewer alternatives and existing products with less competition. Consumers and different purchasers have lacked negotiating power in general.\n\nAt the same time, it seems like more and more people have been getting pieces of the drug price pie. This has included various middle people such as pharmacy benefits managers and different administrators. The marketing budgets of pharmaceutical companies have continued to grow as well. On top of that, investors have expected pharmaceutical companies to have ever increasing profitability.\n\nAll of this means that a single simple intervention probably has a small percentage chance of reducing drug prices in a sustainable manner. Instead, a system approach may be needed, meaning multiple interventions at different points in the system that work together in a coordinated manner. Otherwise, there may be unintended consequences.\n\nA sustainable reduction in drug prices would mean one in which the math would work out for all patients. You don’t want a situation where the prices of some drugs are reduced while those of others are raised. You also don’t want a situation where drug prices are ostensibly lowered but made up by hidden costs that patients end up paying. In other words, should anyone claim that drug prices have been reduced by certain percentage, you want to make sure that the percentage is real.','\n',char(10)),'completed',NULL,'2025-08-03T08:46:45.977491+00:00',6,'2025-08-03 08:35:09',NULL,'rss',0,NULL,'["drug prices", "Donald Trump", "President Donald Trump", "medication prices", "pharmaceutical companies", "White House", "Executive Order", "price controls", "most-favored-nation", "pharmaceutical prices"]',1865,10,'President Donald Trump announced ambitious plans to reduce drug prices in the U.S. by up to 1500%, sending letters to major pharmaceutical companies urging them to align prices with those in other countries.

EDF equips caregivers with essential tools, resources, and support through their Community Caregiver Map (CCM), a vital part of their Hidden Heroes Campaign. The CCM addresses a pivotal challenge: integrating population-level insights with specific mission metrics to understand military and veterans’ caregivers’ health and wellness comprehensively. As EDF gathered more direct feedback from caregivers and expanded data sources with RAND studies and internal surveys, it became clear that the platform needed enhanced capabilities to provide precise, targeted insights into each community’s unique challenges. EDF needed to refine its data analysis and integration capabilities to deliver the right services at the right time to the individuals and communities that need them most. With these challenges in mind, EDF worked with technology company Booz Allen to refine the CCM by integrating real-time data capabilities and more advanced features. The CCM, built on Booz Allen’s EpiMaps platform, leverages data analytics and artificial intelligence (AI) to pinpoint caregiver locations and uncover key determinants of health factors driving specific outcomes that significantly impact their well-being. For this project, technologists at Booz Allen revamped the CCM using their EpiMaps platform, leveraging aiSSEMBLE™, a tool developed by Booz Allen to integrate AI for automating and optimizing data insights. By combining these tools with the robust Salesforce Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system and data visualization software Tableau, EDF gains real-time access to data through Salesforce Data Cloud. Tableau then transforms the data into visualizations that enable deeper analysis of health outcomes and resource distribution across regions, helping prioritize the most impactful solutions. EDF’s enhanced Tableau visualizations offer standard features and customizable maps, making accessing essential insights easy. Through data visualization, EDF can effectively utilize resources, perform holistic evaluations of program effectiveness, and enable informed decision-making at the national, state, and regional levels. Users can focus on county-level health outcomes and adjust data to compare health scores between counties. The tool ranks potential solutions by their impact on improving health scores, using prediction algorithms to prioritize actions based on their estimated effectiveness. By combining Booz Allen’s aiSSEMBLE™ platform with customized data integrations through Salesforce, EDF can now leverage even more dynamic, actionable insights. With the enhanced Community Caregiver Map, EDF now has the ability to: Address individual caregiver needs through tailored data visualizations. Identify gaps in resource allocation based on specific social determinants of health, enabling EDF to channel resources effectively. Equip policymakers with comprehensive, actionable data to create more effective policies to improve outcomes for military and veteran caregivers. Use prediction algorithms to establish priorities and implement targeted strategies. Continuously improve based on live data updates and AI-driven insights. With comprehensive and up-to-date insights into caregiver capacity, predictions of future needs, and, most importantly, the ability to precisely target action plans, EDF is positioned to improve caregiver support at scale. Integrating AI and real-time data allows for ongoing improvements in caregiver support strategies. Salesforce’s cloud-based platform ensures that EDF can scale operations and integrate new data sources over time. Flexible API integrations allow EDF to overlay caregiver data, tailoring insights to unique populations and providing insights for the most efficient resource allocation. This intentional design resulted in an innovative visualization tool that equips EDF to identify, correlate, and compare myriad challenges, unlocking a growing potential for impact. Through this powerful collaboration and technology, the Elizabeth Dole Foundation transforms caregiver support, delivering data-driven solutions that make a difference.','completed',NULL,'2025-08-03T09:45:43.432783+00:00',21,'2025-08-03 08:35:20',NULL,'rss',0,NULL,'["Nonprofit", "Partner Apps"]',1030,4,'The Elizabeth Dole Foundation enhances support for military caregivers through real-time data integration and advanced analytics, improving health outcomes and resource allocation.','["Nonprofit", "Partner Apps"]','en');

He admitted Apple is late to the game but said the company plans to invest aggressively: "Apple must do this. Apple will do this. This is sort of ours to grab."\n\nCook pointed out that Apple is rarely first to market—not with PCs, not with smartphones—but often defines the standard for what comes next. "This is how I feel about AI," he said.\n\nOver the past year, Apple hired 12,000 new employees, with 40 percent joining research and development. Software chief Craig Federighi told staff that Apple is rebuilding Siri from the ground up on a unified architecture, with the new version expected in 2026. Apple is also developing its own AI chips and building a new data center in Houston.\n\nApple plans to ramp up its spending on artificial intelligence and take a more open approach to acquisitions as it faces mounting pressure from competitors and significant internal challenges. During Apple’s latest earnings call, CEO Tim Cook announced that the company is investing significantly more in AI. Apple’s CFO Kevan Parekh added that much of the company’s current growth in spending is due to increased investment in AI.\n\nInternally, Apple is shifting staff to AI-focused projects, aiming to integrate AI features across its platforms. The focus, according to the company, is on delivering personal, privacy-focused, and seamless user experiences. For infrastructure, Apple is relying on servers running its own chips under the name “Private Cloud Compute,” rather than hardware from vendors like Nvidia. Unlike Google or Microsoft, Apple doesn’t operate its own cloud infrastructure, instead using a hybrid model with partner solutions that are accounted for as operating expenses.\n\nCook also said Apple is open to acquisitions of any size if they support its AI strategy. So far this year, Apple has acquired around seven companies, mostly smaller firms, not all of which are AI-related. Apple’s largest acquisition to date was its $3 billion purchase of Beats Electronics in 2014.\n\nDespite the increased spending, Apple remains conservative compared to other tech giants. The company invested $3.46 billion in capital expenditures during the June quarter, while Google, Meta, and Microsoft each plan to spend tens of billions. Cook also brushed off concerns that new AI devices could replace the iPhone, describing them as complementary rather than competitive.\n\nApple’s announcement comes against a backdrop of serious internal issues. Reports point to technical setbacks and dysfunctional management that delayed the rollout of updated Siri features until 2026. Power struggles between John Giannandrea’s AI group and Craig Federighi’s software team reportedly stalled development, leading to a shakeup that put Federighi in charge of Siri. Apple has also struggled with a major shortage of computing power, forcing it to move away from its longstanding strategy of on-device data processing.\n\nThese problems triggered a massive talent exodus, with Meta luring away several key AI researchers with multimillion-dollar contracts. As a result, Apple is reportedly considering a major strategic shift, including talks with OpenAI and Anthropic about using their models for Siri. Under Federighi’s leadership, Apple is said to be open to integrating open-source models if they outperform its own efforts. The new investments and more flexible acquisition strategy appear to be Apple’s response to filling both strategic and personnel gaps.','\n',char(10)),'published',NULL,'2025-08-03T11:36:40.888585+00:00',1,'2025-08-03 08:35:23',NULL,'rss',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL);

The highlight is "Harmonize," an upgrade based on Adobe''s earlier "Project Perfect Blend" experiment. This tool automatically matches the color, lighting, shadows, and overall mood of new image elements, so they blend seamlessly into existing photos. Adobe says that creating convincing composites used to require a lot of expertise with image editing software. The new tool aims to lower that barrier, letting users pick from three composition options to find the most natural look. "Harmonize" is now in beta for Photoshop on both web and desktop, and is already available in early access on iOS. Adobe is also introducing an AI-powered upscaling feature that can boost image resolution up to eight megapixels without sacrificing quality. This is aimed at restoring old photos and adapting images for different platforms. Object removal has gotten an upgrade, too. Adobe says the new version delivers cleaner results, with fewer stray background elements and more realistic fills for erased areas. Both the upscale and object removal features are available now in the web and desktop betas. Photoshop users can now choose between Firefly Image 1 and Image 3 when using "Generative Fill" and "Generative Expand." Adobe says each AI model offers its own style and focus, giving creatives more control over the final image. The company hasn''t explained what sets the models apart or why Firefly Image 2 is missing. The new tools also raise fresh questions about image authenticity. While Photoshop''s existing AI features include guardrails against deepfakes of public figures or violent content, "Harmonize" lets users combine nearly anything, provided they have the right source material. Photoshop has long been synonymous with image manipulation, but AI now makes these capabilities much easier to use. What once took advanced skills can now be done in a few clicks, making high-level editing faster and easier to scale. This shift makes it even more important to track how images are altered. Adobe''s answer is content credentials, a safety layer that logs edits and builds a chain of trust. As Photoshop product manager Joel Baer told The Verge, users also have to follow Adobe''s terms of service, which ban illegal or harmful content.','published',NULL,'2025-08-03T11:16:18.708691+00:00',1,'2025-08-03 08:35:23',NULL,'rss',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL);

But a new study from Denmark suggests that targeted tweaks can make these conversations significantly more constructive. Researchers from the University of Copenhagen set out to systematically test which factors actually drive quality discussions online. Between July and August 2023, the team ran an experiment with 3,303 participants from the US and UK using the Prolific platform. They used GPT-4 to generate arguments. Rather than relying on canned responses or generic topics, the researchers had GPT-4 create counterarguments tailored to each participant''s political beliefs. This approach helped them overcome a common challenge in political science experiments, where studies often depend on unrealistic scenarios or lack experimental control. To test different effects, GPT-4 was instructed to vary its responses across four dimensions: evidence-based vs. emotional arguments, respectful vs. sarcastic tone, willingness to compromise vs. intransigence, and party-affiliated vs. neutral identity. Three human coders reviewed the participant responses using a standard rubric. The team also ran additional checks to ensure the AI-generated arguments matched the assigned instructions and that there was no content overlap between test groups. Their results build on earlier research showing that GPT-4''s arguments can be just as convincing and original as human ones, as long as quality controls are in place. When the LLM used a respectful tone, participants were 9 percentage points more likely to give high-quality responses. Evidence-based arguments boosted quality by 6 points, and signaling a willingness to compromise added another 5 points. Surprisingly, party identity had little influence. People did not respond much differently to arguments from political opponents compared to those from their own side. In fact, arguments without any party affiliation worked best. Combining all the positive factors more than doubled the chance of a constructive reply, raising it from 24% to 47%. The elements also interacted: for example, evidence-based arguments made disrespect less likely, and openness to compromise encouraged the other side to offer better justifications. The experiment revealed subtle dynamics. Evidence-based arguments improved justification quality and reduced disrespectful replies. Willingness to compromise made participants on the other side more likely to engage constructively, even when the original argument''s quality wasn''t varied. While the interventions led to better discourse, they didn''t shift people''s core political views. Higher-quality discussion improved the overall tone but rarely led to changes in opinion. Still, participants did become more open to alternative perspectives. However, polarization only dropped slightly when arguments came from someone sharing the participant''s party affiliation. The researchers argue that learning better ways to argue is key to healthier democratic debate online. AI could help social platforms steer users toward more productive conversations if they choose to use these tools.','completed',NULL,'2025-08-03T11:15:28.525842+00:00',3,'2025-08-03 08:35:23',NULL,'rss',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL);

Amazon has the watch for full price, but is offering a $50 promotional credit toward a future purchase if you use the code APSUE5MBXB6Y at checkout. The Galaxy Watch 8 is squircle shaped, which may be divisive, but allows it to lay flatter and Verge reporter Victoria Song found it fit more comfortably on her wrist in her review. The change also let Samsung make the watch thinner than the Galaxy Watch 7, and yet we still found it can still last more than a day on a charge. While it’s not a huge departure from its predecessor, it could be a good upgrade for anyone with a Galaxy Watch 5 or below, and Samsung’s new discount counteracts the $50 price increase means you’re not paying any more than the Galaxy Watch 7 cost at launch. If you’ve gotten used to Google Gemini on your smartphone or computer, the Galaxy Watch 8 will let you access it from your wrist – we created playlists, checked the weather, and have previously asked Gemini whether it’s necessary to scrub a sweet potato before peeling it. On the health and wellness side, the Galaxy Watch 8 can track steps, your heart rate, blood oxygen level, steps, and activity.

Antitrust trade publication MLex reported that termination letters for Roger Alford and Bill Rinner, who also served in the first Trump administration, did not mention the reason for their firing. (Alford later posted a copy of his letter, which he said he framed and hung in his University of Notre Dame office.)

While the summer doldrums have hit Washington, the MAGA influencers can never truly go on vacation, especially if they’ve spent their careers promising to reveal the truth about Jeffrey Epstein. Although their politicians are now in power, they’re getting stonewalled, and in the absence of juicy “Epstein files” to feed to their audiences, a new maelstrom of discontent is brewing, one that implicates much more than allegations about a pedophile’s sex trafficking ring. The complex rift around Donald Trump’s loyalists and the diehard Epstein truthers can no longer be separated from the issue of Israel, and as days pass, vocal criticism of the Israeli government is becoming louder and louder inside the American right wing — something that was once unthinkable. It should be emphasized that some of the most anti-Israel voices on the right are simply open antisemites, and that’s using the word in the narrowest possible sense. (For example, white nationalist Nick Fuentes has espoused Holocaust denial and praised Hitler.) It is also true, however, that Israel is currently engaged in an internationally unpopular asymmetric war in Gaza, and that there is an outstanding arrest warrant issued by the International Criminal Court for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for the war crime of starvation as a method of warfare. For the hardened antisemite, the mere fact that Epstein was Jewish establishes a connection between the so-called Epstein files and Israel; elsewhere in the MAGAverse, major figures (like Tucker Carlson) advance the theory that the billionaire sex offender was a Mossad asset. (This theory is bolstered in part by long-standing rumors that Ghislaine Maxwell’s father was a Mossad agent.) The faction highlighting both Epstein and Israel is either nonideological (such as Theo Von, who pressed JD Vance on the Epstein files and has questioned “why we [America] support Israel”), deeply populist and/or conspiratorial, and sometimes a combination of these categories. Tucker Carlson’s two most recent podcasts, for instance, were deep dives into Epstein’s history and heavy criticism of Israeli military strikes on Christian churches in Gaza — just weeks after he referenced the Epstein Mossad theory at the TPUSA conference. Alex Jones has run nonstop coverage of Epstein developments this week and on Wednesday hosted a debate with Fuentes wherein he called the Trump administration an “absolute failure.” But shockingly, the faction that’s attempted to support Trump while placating their audience has pivoted as well: Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, a MAGA megastar who somehow balances her support of Trump with her frequent antisemitism, went even further and called Netanyahu’s actions a “genocide.” Both Matt Gaetz and Steve Bannon, whose Epstein messaging waxes and wanes, recently called the situation in Gaza a political liability for Trump. As a news event, it’s impossible to ignore Netanyahu’s occupation of Gaza and the subsequent humanitarian crisis, and how it’s chipped away at Americans’ sentiment toward the state of Israel, now at historic lows. Trump himself notably broke with Netanyahu on Monday, telling reporters that he did not believe the prime minister’s claims that children were not starving in Gaza. “Based on television … those children look very hungry,” Trump said, adding later: “I see it, and you can’t fake that.” While unclear if they would have begun criticizing Israel if Trump hadn’t done it first, the influencers’ pivot was inevitable if one looks at the shifting attitudes of the podcast-listening demographic. A Pew poll published last year found that only half of young Republican men between 18 and 34 were sympathetic to Israel’s actions, while the other half were either opposed or unsure — a shocking statistic compared to older Republicans, who overwhelmingly supported Israel. It hasn’t gotten better since: a Gallup poll released this Tuesday found that while a majority of self-identified Republicans continued to support Israel’s actions in Gaza, 51 percent of men, 54 percent of white people, and a staggering 82 percent of people between the ages of 18 and 34 did not. Maintaining a good relationship with MAGA influencers is a rather different dynamic than maintaining their alliance with Fox News. For the Trump team and the Republican Party as a whole, it’s becoming clearer that maintaining a good relationship with MAGA influencers is a rather different dynamic than maintaining their alliance with Fox News. A single influencer is held accountable to their audience and the comments section, whereas if a Fox talking head goes rogue, the White House can call Rupert Murdoch — whose media empire, and particularly Fox, needs access to the White House — and wrangle them back into line. (Incidentally, over the past week, according to a Media Matters analysis published Thursday, Fox News spent a cumulative three minutes talking about Epstein, and 85 minutes talking about Sydney Sweeney’s denim controversy.) Even if the Trump administration establishes a symbiotic relationship with some influencers, with the expectation that they parrot Trump’s line about Epstein (or Israel), they may find that their power to persuade only goes so far. A recent example from the manosphere demonstrates the limit of an influencer to, well, influence: earlier this month, the Nelk Boys, two Canadian right-wing bro podcasters, posted an interview with Netanyahu, whose government (and, by extension, Israel) has become increasingly unpopular with younger Americans due to his actions in Gaza. It backfired completely: their audience immediately began accusing the two of platforming a genocidal Zionist, going ballistic when the hosts admitted that the Israeli government fed them questions, and drew criticism from leftist streamer Hasan Piker and Nick Fuentes during the same livestream. Their YouTube channel has lost over 20,000 subscribers since posting the interview, according to Social Blade. But being on the White House’s good side does have its benefits even if one loses followers: Laura Loomer, one of the loudest voices calling for Epstein documents, has recently dialed down her trutherism and instead clung harder to the White House’s official continued support on Israel: In a post criticizing Zohran Mamdani, the current Democrat nominee in the New York City mayoral race, she announced that she would never “feel safe with Muslims holding office in America” and that she didn’t care about who she offended. “This is why I will never care about Gaza,” she added. Unconditional loyalty, however, does have its benefits: Loomer’s been credited with convincing Trump to fire over a dozen officials for perceived MAGA disloyalty.','completed',NULL,'2025-08-03T11:08:16.793503+00:00',2,'2025-08-03 08:35:23',NULL,'rss',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL);

Echoing the slogan that exemplified his energy policies during the campaign, he made his message clear: more oil and gas, lower prices, greater exports.\n\nSix months into Trump’s second term, his administration has little to show on that score. Output is ticking up, but slower than it did under the Biden administration. Pump prices for gasoline have bobbed around where they were in inauguration week. And exports of crude oil in the four months through April trailed those in the same period last year.\n\nThe White House is discovering, perhaps the hard way, that energy markets aren’t easily managed from the Oval Office—even as it moves to roll back regulations on the oil and gas sector, offers up more public lands for drilling at reduced royalty rates, and axes Biden-era incentives for wind and solar.\n\n“The industry is going to do what the industry is going to do,” said Jenny Rowland-Shea, director for public lands at the Center for American Progress, a progressive policy think tank.\n\nThat’s because the price of oil, the world’s most-traded commodity, is more responsive to global demand and supply dynamics than to domestic policy and posturing.\n\nThe market is flush with supplies at the moment, as the Saudi Arabia-led cartel of oil-producing nations known as OPEC+ allows more barrels to flow, while China, the world’s top oil consumer, curbs its consumption. Within the US, a boom in energy demand driven by rapid electrification and AI-serving data centers is boosting power costs for homes and businesses, yet fossil fuel producers are not rushing to ramp up drilling.\n\nThere is one key indicator of drilling levels that the industry has watched closely for more than 80 years: a weekly census of active oil and gas rigs published by Baker Hughes. When Trump came into office on January 20, the US rig count was 580. Last week, the most recent figure, it was down to 542—hovering just above a four-year low reached earlier in the month.\n\nThe most glaring factor behind this stagnant rig count is the current level of crude oil prices. Take the US benchmark grade: West Texas Intermediate crude. Its prices were near $66 a barrel on July 28, after hitting a four-year low of $62 in May. The break-even level for drilling new wells is somewhere close to $60 per barrel, according to oil and gas experts.\n\nThat’s before you account for the fallout of elevated tariffs on steel and other imports for the many companies that get their pipes and drilling equipment from overseas, said Robert Rapier, editor-in-chief of Shale Magazine, who has two decades of experience as a chemical engineer.\n\nThe Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas’ quarterly survey of over 130 oil and gas producers based in Texas, Louisiana, and New Mexico, conducted in June, suggests the industry’s outlook is pessimistic. Nearly half of the 38 firms that responded to this question saw their firms drilling fewer wells this year than they had earlier expected.\n\nSurvey participants could also submit comments. One executive from an exploration and production (E&P) company said, “It’s hard to imagine how much worse policies and DC rhetoric could have been for US E&P companies.” Another executive said, “The Liberation Day chaos and tariff antics have harmed the domestic energy industry. ‘Drill, baby, drill’ will not happen with this level of volatility.”\n\nRoughly one in three survey respondents chalked up the expectations for fewer wells to higher tariffs on steel imports. And three in four said tariffs raised the cost of drilling and completing new wells.\n\n“They’re getting more places to drill and they’re getting some lower royalties, but they’re also getting these tariffs that they don’t want,” Rapier said. “And the bottom line is their profits are going to suffer.”\n\nEarlier this month, ExxonMobil estimated that its profit in the April–June quarter will be roughly $1.5 billion lower than in the previous three months because of weaker oil and gas prices. And over in Europe, BP, Shell, and TotalEnergies issued similar warnings to investors about hits to their respective profits.\n\nThese warnings come even as Trump has installed friendly faces to regulate the oil and gas sector, including at the Department of Energy, the Environmental Protection Agency, and the Department of the Interior, the latter of which manages federal lands and is gearing up to auction more oil and gas leases on those lands.\n\n“There’s a lot of enthusiasm for a window of opportunity to make investments. But there’s also a lot of caution about wanting to make sure that if there’s regulatory reforms, they’re going to stick,” said Kevin Book, managing director of research at ClearView Energy Partners, which produces analyses for energy companies and investors.\n\nThe recently enacted One Big Beautiful Bill Act contains provisions requiring four onshore and two offshore lease sales every year, lowering the minimum royalty rate to 12.5 percent from 16.67 percent and bringing back speculative leasing—when lands that don’t invite enough bids are leased for less money—that was stopped in 2022.\n\n“Pro-energy policies play a critical role in strengthening domestic production,” said a spokesperson for the American Petroleum Institute, the top US oil and gas industry group. “The new tax legislation unlocks opportunities for safe, responsible development in critical resource basins to deliver the affordable, reliable fuel Americans rely on.”\n\nBecause about half of the federal royalties end up with the states and localities where the drilling occurs, “budgets in these oil and gas communities are going to be hit hard,” Rowland-Shea of American Progress said. Meanwhile, she said, drilling on public lands can pollute the air, raise noise levels, cause spills or leaks, and restrict movement for both people and wildlife.\n\nEarlier this year, Congress killed an EPA rule finalized in November that would have charged oil and gas companies for flaring excess methane from their operations.\n\n“Folks in the Trump camp have long said that the Biden administration was killing drilling by enforcing these regulations on speculative leasing and reining in methane pollution,” said Rowland-Shea. “And yet under Biden, we saw the highest production of oil and gas in history.”\n\nIn fact, the top three fossil fuel producers collectively earned less during Trump’s first term than they did in either of President Barack Obama’s terms or under President Joe Biden. “It’s an irony that when Democrats are in there and they’re putting in policies to shift away from oil and gas, which causes the price to go up, that is more profitable for the oil and gas industry,” said Rapier.\n\nThat doesn’t mean, of course, that the Trump administration’s actions won’t have long-lasting climate implications. Even though six months may be a significant amount of time in political accounting, investment decisions in the energy sector are made over longer horizons, ClearView’s Book said. As long as the planned lease sales take place, oil companies can snap up and sit on public lands until they see more favorable conditions for drilling.\n\nWhat could pad the demand for oil and gas is how the One Big Beautiful Bill Act will withdraw or dilute the Inflation Reduction Act’s tax incentives and subsidies for renewable energy sources. “With the kneecapping of wind and solar, that’s going to put a lot more pressure on fossil fuels to fill that gap,” Rowland-Shea said.\n\nHowever, the economics of solar and wind are increasingly too attractive to ignore. With electricity demand exceeding expectations, Book said, “any president looking ahead at end-user prices and power supply might revisit or take a flexible position if they find themselves facing shortage.”\n\nA recent United Nations report found that “solar and wind are now almost always the least expensive—and the fastest—option for new electricity generation.” That is why Texas, deemed the oil capital of the world, produces more wind power than any other state and also led the nation in new solar capacity in the last two years.\n\nRenewables like wind and solar, said Rowland-Shea, are “a truly abundant and American source of energy.”','\n',char(10)),'completed',NULL,'2025-08-03T09:46:47.263427+00:00',3,'2025-08-03 08:35:23',NULL,'rss',0,NULL,'["climate desk"]',1860,8,'This article discusses the stagnation of oil drilling in the U.S. under President Trump''s administration, despite promises to increase production.

GPT-5 will likely deliver the first general-purpose, consumer-grade agent that can act on a user’s behalf, not just chat.\n\n**Coding agents** – Anthropic’s Claude paired with Cursor shows what happens when you post-train with reinforcement learning onto a strong base model and aim it at software engineering. Code is a good proving ground because outcomes are objectively testable, much like math problems.\n\n**Enterprise agents** – We believe this is the next frontier – i.e. agents powered by a live digital twin of the business. Not digital twins of something physical such as a factory like Nvidia Corp.’s Omniverse, rather an enterprise. Here the landscape changes. It’s not just about bigger models; it’s new vendor tech stacks, new vendor business models, and new customer operating models that we’ll explain. The value is so large that even Jamie Dimon, with his huge balance sheet and orders of magnitude more useful data than frontier labs have access to, is stepping onto Sam Altman’s playing field.\n\nWith that framing in place, let’s walk through why the jump from consumer/coder agents to enterprise agents is not a linear extrapolation, and what new technology and organizational layers have to materialize before Jamie Dimon can realistically challenge OpenAI’s lead.\n\nAdditional color on the three eras of agentic AI\n\nWe make the following additional points on this topic:\n\nDimon, as we’ve talked about before, is a proxy for enterprises and the proprietary data and know-how that they have within their four walls that frontier LLMs cannot train on. This is why the real value will come from enterprises applying that data and know-how to extending the frontier LLMs or models that are similar to that and we’ll explain why.\n\nThe real revolution is that we’ve moved from scaling laws in the pre-training era—which is the GPT models that ChatGPT and similar products were built on, to the post-training era, which is where we start using reinforcement learning. Reinforcement learning is a fancy term for trial-and-error learning and, for trial-and-error, you have to be able to learn from your mistakes.\n\nIt first works in **software-engineering agents** because code gives immediate, objective feedback:\n\nYou can run a test and see if it works – you can compile it.\nIt fits into a programmer’s workflow without huge changes.\nSo that’s where agents in the enterprise first take off. And then our contention is that to go beyond that is where we’re going to need a new type of technology platform — the enterprise digital twin.\n\nTo get real value out of that, we’re going to have to go with a new—not just new technology model at the foundation where the data is — but a new **operations model** where firms have to organize around end-to-end outcomes like onboarding a new customer, not departmental or functional specialization.\n\nVendor implications:\n\nVendors must provide end-to-end process-centric data platforms or digital twins. It’s not the conventional data platforms or the siloed applications.\nIt appears we’re going to need **open-weight models** for this trial-and-error learning to work properly, and that’s incompatible with the frontier model vendors’ business models.\n\nAs such, we’re going to need lots of changes. And the main point is that Jamie Dimon (as a proxy for leading enterprises) and the value he’s going to extract from this era of AI is going to need completely different scaffolding and sets of business models for customers like him, as well as the vendors that supply him, compared to the era where ChatGPT is creating and capturing value today.\n\nIn short, we believe this shift — from pre-training scale to post-training skill, and from siloed workflows to outcome-centric twins — sets the competitive chessboard for the next decade of enterprise AI.','\n',char(10)),'completed',NULL,'2025-08-05T09:18:45.914365+00:00',12,'2025-08-04 16:10:49',NULL,'rss',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL);

It can help research and write papers, draw illustrations, compose music, and create videos. But it can also make things up and disseminate ideas that can cause harm. Without proper instruction, students may accept false information as fact, use AI to avoid thinking for themselves, and fall victim to AI-generated content.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n* * *\n\n* * *\n\nNot surprisingly, Massachusetts school districts are all over the map in how they are using AI in the classrooms. Some schools are encouraging teachers to use AI to assist with creating educational materials. In Leominster and Nantucket, students can use personalized tutors and even converse with AI versions of historical figures, according to officials in those municipalities. But many schools have yet to introduce AI at all.\n\nThey all should be teaching some form of AI literacy. That means helping students understand how AI is made, where its information comes from, its limitations, and the ethical, social, and environmental implications of its use. It also includes teaching students the basics of AI safety, emphasizing the risks of hallucinations (when an AI tool generates incorrect information), and learning how to critically evaluate its output.\n\nAs Rebecca Winthrop, director of the Center for Universal Education at the Brookings Institution, explained to the editorial board, there is a difference between using AI tools and teaching AI literacy. “If you’re having a deeper, more engaging learning experience, if you’re interactively talking with AI Abraham Lincoln, that’s cool; kids will be more engaged, and they’ll learn,” Winthrop said. “However, that alone is not going to do the trick. You need kids to really understand, ‘what is this technology?’”\n\nAI literacy can take on many forms, from a separate class to being incorporated into students’ interactions with AI Abraham Lincoln. Teachers can start that activity off with an overview of what generative AI is and explain that the AI Lincoln’s words are fictional and generated.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n* * *\n\n* * *\n\nWhile some concepts might seem appropriate only for high school students, some districts are introducing them in middle or even elementary school. Gwinnett County, Georgia, in addition to having an AI-themed high school, created a cluster of public schools specifically focused on integrating AI education across subjects and age groups.\n\nAt the elementary school level in that Georgia county, students learn about programming and algorithms and teachers connect those concepts to other technologies, including AI. The district’s director of artificial intelligence and computer science, Sallie Holloway, emphasized to the editorial board the importance of introducing AI in a way that demystifies it, helping students understand that AI is programmed by humans and is not a “magic black box.” This type of education prepares students to navigate AI outside the classroom in a safer manner.\n\nMassachusetts should follow suit. It endangers students not to. While the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education is preparing to release resources to help educators navigate AI, including a one-hour AI literacy module, it is not enough. And the department seems to know this.\n\n“This module is not going to solve all of the challenges related to generative AI in school. I do not want to oversell it,” Jackie Gantzer, the department’s director of edtech and school support, told the editorial board. “Truly, this, right now, is focused on those most basic elements.”\n\nTeachers should not be expected to learn about AI literacy on their own and integrate it into their current curriculum on top of all their other responsibilities. The state needs to create more professional development opportunities so teachers can understand how to teach AI literacy, and it should provide clear curriculum guidance, knowing that the material will likely evolve. As rapidly as AI tools are being introduced to students inside or outside of school, AI literacy must be taught.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n* * *\n\n* * *\n\nWe know what happens if we don’t teach it. We have seen it with social media. Most students were never taught how algorithms manipulate attention, how false information spreads, or how these platforms profit from engagement.

But whether that adoption is enough to save graduates from the pace of workplace disruption remains unclear. In response, applicants are already shifting their strategy.\n\nMicrosoft cofounder Bill Gates has advice for recent graduates: Embrace AI tools, but don’t expect any stability when it comes to the job search.\n\nGates said smart systems have generally unearthed opportunities that are “fun and empowering,” he told CNN. However, that may not mean ambitious college graduates will land their dream jobs just by using AI; it’s still a tough job market despite understanding these applications.\n\n“Embracing [AI], and tracking it, will be very, very important,” Gates said. “That doesn’t guarantee we’re not going to have a lot of dislocation.”\n\nGates said he hasn’t changed his recommendations for young people: “Be curious, read, and use the latest tools,” he said.\n\nGen Z is increasingly burned out from job hunting before even getting started. Frustrated applicants have lamented on TikTok about the number of rejection emails they have received from companies and expressed fears that the job market feels broken. And recent data backs them up: Entry-level job postings in the U.S. overall dwindled by about 35% since January 2023, and roles that are easily automated by AI are experiencing a disproportionately large impact.\n\nA recent survey found 49% of U.S. Gen Z job hunters believe AI has reduced the value of their degrees. Meanwhile, the unemployment rate for recent college grads has climbed above 6% over the past 12 months ending in May, while the overall national unemployment rate hovers around 4%.\n\nAI replacing entry-level work is already being felt across all industries. At global investment firm Carlyle, previous entry-level hires who evaluated deals used to turn to Google for articles and request documents manually. Now the work is being done by AI, and the firm is shifting toward hiring junior-level employees who can ensure the work is accurate.\n\nCEOs have also iterated their hiring strategy. Bill Balderaz, CEO of Columbus-based consulting firm Futurety, told the Wall Street Journal he decided not to hire a summer intern this year, opting to run social media copy through ChatGPT instead.\n\nFor Gen Z entering the workforce, the career game is shifting. Much like investors turn to Treasury bonds during times of economic uncertainty, many younger workers are reveling in the security of blue-collar work and roles rooted in human connection, creativity, and physical skills.\n\nA recent survey of 1,000 Gen Z workers showed 53% are gravitating toward skilled or licensed trades in construction, plumbing, and electrical. Jobs installing elevators earn up to six figures and don’t require a college degree, for instance. Next in line are people-focused professions, such as health care, education, and social work.\n\nDid your workplace make our list of the 100 Best Companies to Work For?

It can be used as a tabletop, camera, lavalier and handheld mic.','2025-08-04 16:00:00+00:00',replace('The new BOYA Magic is a wireless microphone that can shape shift depending on the job such as a desktop mic for a video conference.\n\nMicrophone brand BOYA is expanding its lineup of wireless microphones with a new kind of product aimed at content creators working across a range of media who need a microphone kit for a variety of scenarios.\n\nLaunching on Kickstarter today is the new BOYA Magic wireless microphone system. This device is different from the usual wireless lavalier microphone kits offered by the likes of RØDE and Shure. Magic is a shape-shifting modular design that can easily adapt to suit a whole range of recording scenarios that can’t be covered with regular wireless microphone kits.\n\nThe concept of the BOYA Magic is a little like Sennheiser’s Profile wireless mic system in that it can be used as a lavalier microphone kit or as a handheld microphone for interviews. The device measures just 13mm thick and each of the two microphone transmitters weighs just 7g.\n\nThe two microphones can transition between lavalier, handheld, desktop and on-camera use. They have a range of up to 100 meters and a full battery charge provides up to six hours use.\n\nThis all-new product from BOYA is the third product launched by the company this year. The first two were BOYAMIC 2 and BOYALINK 3, wireless microphone systems that focus on capturing high-fidelity sound and everyday content capture, respectively.\n\nThese two new products were the first to use BOYA’s latest AI-driven acoustic architecture. BOYA Magic also uses the same technology, enabling it to produce a more flexible microphone system that can adapt to a range of different shooting styles and content creation.\n\nModern content creation is becoming increasingly fluid with creatives having to record interviews, shoot vlogs, live stream and lay down voiceovers over videos, often in a single workflow. However, most of the sound recording equipment available to content creators remains fragmented, which can create a significant friction point.\n\nThe design of BOYA Magic is a direct response to this trend towards multimedia production with fluid content creation. Instead of requiring separate microphones for each shooting scenario, BOYA Magic consolidates four common configurations in one device that’s small enough to fit in a pocket.\n\nThe two wireless microphone transmitters nestle inside BOYA Magic’s charging case. Each microphone weighs just 7g and when used in desktop or on-camera mode, the mics pair with a receiver built into the ultra-compact charging.\n\nDespite its compact size, the charging case includes two wireless receivers for the lavalier microphone transmitters. There’s a small receiver for plugging in directly to a smartphone with a choice of USB-C or Lightning connectors. Then there is a second receiver for plugging into a camera or audio recorder. The transmitters can support audio recording up to 48kHz/24-bit and have a 144 dB dynamic range.\n\nThe BOYA Magic also uses AI-based real-time noise filtering that’s been trained on more than 700,000 audio samples. The system also includes a smart limiter to prevent clipping and it can record two signals, including a -12dB safety track.\n\nThe device powers on automatically as soon as the two mics are removed from the charging case and can begin recording with default settings that are tuned for the most common setups. For even faster operation, users can control the microphones directly through the charging case using an external button. BOYA says this innovative design is a feature that is in the process of being patented.\n\nFor those seeking more customization, the BOYA Central smartphone app can be used to control the BOYA Magic and offers access to EQ presets and noise-cancellation modes. It’s a setting that could appeal to mobile-first creators, solo operators and content teams who need to turn their content around quickly, especially when working on location where bulky equipment and the need to reconfigure can slow down production.\n\nBOYA Magic uses the same audio processing core in BOYAMIC 2 and BOYALINK 3. However, this time it’s been repackaged in a physical design that’s more flexible. By combining multiple recording setups in a single and compact unit, the company claims BOYA Magic can reduce gear redundancy and make it easier to capture high-quality audio for more engaging content.\n\nWhether more creators will embrace this departure from conventional wireless microphone products remains to be seen. But for those working across a range of content creation, whether they are on the move, on location or streaming online, Magic could be the sign of a shift towards a lighter and more flexible recording kit.\n\nThe BOYA Magic is available now with prices starting at $90.\n\n**Transmitters**\n- Dimensions: 35 x 15.2 x 13mm.\n- Sample rate: 48kHz 24-bit.\n- Signal-to-noise ratio: >80dB.\n- Frequency response: 20Hz – 20kHz.\n- Dynamic range: 144dB.\n- Transmission range: 100m.\n- Battery life: 6 hours.\n\n**Receivers:**\n- Playback: Yes.\n- Charging while recording: Yes.\n- Adapter design: Lightning, USB-C, 3.5mm.\n\n**Charging case**\n- Dimensions: 141.3 x 26.5 x 21mm.\n- Weight: 62.5g.\n- Battery capacity: 500mAh.\n- Combined battery range: 30 hours.','\n',char(10)),'published',NULL,'2025-08-05T09:24:08.511844+00:00',5,'2025-08-04 16:10:49',NULL,'rss',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL);

Data suggests that these financial pressures have increased beyond what was forecasted. The Chronicle of Higher Education recently released a report suggesting that two-thirds of colleges showed signs of financial stress. Furthermore, last month, BestColleges.com published a tracking system for college closures and mergers. Some might argue that this financial distress reflects negative views about colleges and universities. However, Gallup reported last month that the public trust in higher education has increased for the first time in decades, and that this increase was among college graduates, those without degrees, Democrats, and Republicans.\n\nPublic confidence cannot meet financial demands, especially the costs of essential services such as student mental health. Schools are tasked with adopting innovative ways to chart the future, and a prime example is a resource-sharing consortium called MINDful College Connections (MCC). According to the MCC website, current members of this consortium include DePauw University, Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology, Saint Mary-Of-The Woods College, and Bulter University. Dr. Curtis Wiseley is the current Executive Director of the MCC, and said the consortium started because there were limited resources and growing demand for well-being services, and individual schools couldn’t keep up. However, Wiseley argued that sharing resources has made a significant impact. He commented, “Together, we have developed a sustainable model of efficiently shared resources to effectively support our students'' mental health needs while also financially benefiting our institutions by leveraging the consortium model to take advantage of economies of scale.”\n\nWiseley explained that the MCC is a separate non-profit organization that was launched by external endowment funding, and that members utilize both a full-time counselor and a mental health wellness educator. According to Wiseley, there’s an operational committee, which includes the counseling directors of each school and determines peak times/situations where one school might need additional resources. For example, if one school is hosting a campus-wide mental health awareness week, the health educators from the other schools will travel to that campus to assist. If there’s a critical incident on a campus, the counselors from the other schools will travel to that campus and provide extra services.\n\nWisely also explained that the MCC provides significant cost-saving initiatives because it negotiates with vendors as a collective to provide discounted prices on services such as electronic medical records, third-party virtual counseling, and online peer support services. Wiseley further discussed how MCC offers professional development to faculty and staff at each school.\n\nDr. John Mark Day is the Vice President of Student Affairs at Depauw University, and he shared how the MCC has also fostered a sense of connection between schools. He commented, “Working in a rural institution, you can feel isolated at times, but this provides a connection with other schools, which has been meaningful.”\n\nAccording to Wiseley, the MCC has enabled schools to expand the delivery of clinical and preventive services on their campuses, including most schools eliminating prior waiting lists in their counseling centers. However, Wiseley said that he’s most excited about the effect of MCC on student retention rates. The executive director shared data which indicated a three-year trend of significant decreases in the percentage of total student withdrawals that were due to mental health reasons. He commented, “The MCC member institutions have documented significant increases in student retention following the implementation of MCC''s comprehensive stepped care treatment model to effectively support the mental health and wellness needs of their students.”\n\nThe MCC is proving that the concept of resource sharing amongst schools can be effective in building connections, expanding resources, and generating important outcomes. The consortium is open for new members, and Wiseley said that he’s willing to talk with school administrators, and even government officials, about how the MCC works. It’s apparent that resource-sharing can be more of a future model in college mental health to help schools fill in service gaps. As Mark Day stated, “MCC has drastically increased our capacity. For most of the schools, we are in rural locations, and this allows us to provide access to services that we couldn’t otherwise provide.”','\n',char(10)),'published',NULL,'2025-08-05T10:05:14.888570+00:00',2,'2025-08-04 16:10:49',NULL,'rss',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL);

We know that generative AI has already become ubiquitous, so that it is now bidding to augment, assist and even replace the things we do. GPU company CEO Jensen Huang declared earlier this year that “English is the new programming language” and tools like Codex and Claude Code are generating apps and resolving GitHub issues. With digital applications becoming more prevalent than ever, some think the value of coding skills may be eroding.\n\nSo then, is vibe coding and writing now the de facto standard… and, is coding itself dead and buried?\n\n[Dr. Rania Khalaf](https://www.linkedin.com/in/raniakhalaf/) is chief AI officer at application development and identity access management company WSO2. Khalaf reminds us that humans have always wanted to communicate with computers as naturally as we do with one another. From punch cards to DOS prompts to GUIs and the mouse, she thinks we’ve come a long way. But since the world had its ChatGPT moment, even Alexa and Siri feel outdated. On the other side, programming computers has evolved from assembly to high-level languages… and now to vibe coding.\n\n## Future Coding Is Hybrid\n\n**“** On the surface, we appear to face a choice: the use of natural language or traditional code to create digital applications. Suggesting that programming is dead sells clicks, but it’s misleading,” said Khalaf, speaking to press and analysts at a coding symposium. “The future is in fact hybrid - a fusion of symbolic, deterministic coding and descriptive, nondeterministic language. We must teach and learn both, from computing fundamentals, coding constructs and systems architecture, alongside a clear understanding of language and how to guide generative systems.”\n\nShe then delivers what may be the killer line in this discussion by saying that “prompting alone is brittle”, which is perhaps a realization that many have failed to step back and consider. But how is this suggestion validated?\n\nPrompt engineering emerged as a purely natural language-based way to coax systems into exhibiting the behaviour required of them. McKinsey calls it the practice of designing inputs for AI tools that will produce optimal outputs. IBM says prompt engineering is critical because it directly influences the quality, relevance and accuracy of generative AI outputs. “A well-crafted prompt helps ensure that the AI comprehends the user''s intent and produces meaningful responses, minimising the need for extensive postprocessing,” notes [Vrunda Gadesha,](https://www.ibm.com/think/author/vrunda-gadesha) AI advocate at IBM.\n\nKhalaf says that prompt engineering is already being replaced by the broader concept of “ [context engineering](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/tom-yeh_contextengineering-rag-mcp-activity-7346178926668353536-i7VM?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAAAAjyQABUTY1iETuJWJzibvSIwJx_w5bmzQ)”, which requires a deeper understanding of programming because it touches on the subsystems, tools and external sources at play.\n\n“Approaches like DSPy intermingle deterministic coding with prompts by letting users create optimizable, programmatic pipelines around prompt building blocks. Our own work on [Natural Programming](https://blog.ballerina.io/posts/2025-04-26-introducing-natural-programming/) introduces natural expressions and natural functions into a general purpose programming language so users can choose to use either natural language or code in different parts of your program depending on what works best for the logic you want to express,” explained Khalaf.\n\nShe thinks that the level of abstraction is being raised yet again. The logic of programs is now an interweaving of code, natural language and eventually images and audio.\n\nThis evolution provides an extra tool in the toolbox. If you grew up in a multilingual culture, it’s kind of like when you reach for the phrase in whatever language best expresses our intention… the same can now be done with programming. It is therefore evident that programming is becoming a collaborative process between human and machine, resulting in multilingual artifacts mixing prose and code.\n\n## Lessons From Peanut Butter & Jelly\n\n“I once led a group of students at a NYC school through the famous Peanut Butter and Jelly Sandwich exercise that went viral in [this YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDA3_5982h8). Participants write a set of instructions that, when followed verbatim, should result in an edible PB&J sandwich. It’s harder than it sounds, showing the gap between intention and execution,” said Khalaf.\n\nShe references Edsger Dijsktra, one of the founders of modern computer science, who wrote lamenting “ [the foolishness of natural language programming](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~EWD/transcriptions/EWD06xx/EWD667.html)”, stating that, “When all is said and told, the ‘naturalness’ with which we use our native tongues boils down to the ease with which we can use them for making statements the nonsense of which is not obvious.”\n\n“Imagine expressing an algorithm or a proof with words instead of mathematics (or code). It is painful. That’s the reason programmers may baulk when offered to write certain tasks in natural language that is used to generate code and prefer to write the code directly themselves. On the other hand, generative AI models do much better at certain tasks with minimal input,” clarified Khalaf. “For example, summarizing an article, analyzing sentiment in text, or answering questions on a corpus they know of. Writing that logic from scratch in code is painful and using a generative AI model would be preferred. It may also be preferred for situations where the model is able to generate all the details needed from a high-level description and the developer is able to understand, debug and maintain the resulting program. Again, we see that the future of programming systems is hybrid: a mix of code plus prose.”\n\n## The Illusion Of Fluency\n\nIn light of these observations, people building programs at any level will now need to understand both and will still need to learn to code, but how they learn and what they learn exactly is likely to change. When we create a program without touching or seeing code, it creates an “illusion of fluency” in our minds We might be able to get something up and running, but without understanding how it works or why it does what it does.\n\nWhen it is time to change something, fix a problem, or handle choices about underlying systems or quality of service needs, Khalaf insists that the creator is at an impasse. The suggestion here is that students with that kind of (lack of) understanding can indeed create code faster, but they struggle to take it to the next steps or explain how their application will behave in certain situations.\n\nKhalaf points to an exposition in support of coding by authors from the Raspberry Pi Foundation, which explains that learning to program goes beyond computing literacy to providing what they call “digital agency” now, helping people shape and participate in the digital world rather than simply being influenced by it. When people study software engineering, programming education doesn’t only cover coding constructs; it also necessitates an understanding of how to break a problem down into its component parts and how to be specific enough so that the solution can be realized and executed.\n\n## Blended Prose & Code\n\n“These, I believe, are life skills that underpin a powerful systems thinking approach to problem solving. In brief, computational thinking matters more than pure coding ability,” said Khalaf. **“** AI will be as integral to software as data and APIs are today. The future software engineer will also be an AI engineer. But this role demands a rare blend - fluency in both prose and code. STEM-trained developers may struggle with writing; liberal arts graduates may fear code. To bridge this, universities are considering computer science curricula within liberal arts programs,” concluded Khalaf.\n\nSoftware application development is clearly seeing a fundamental transformation. The aperture is widening, bringing creation into the hands of more people. Technology advocates and evangelists think that we can be certain of one immediate future truth: the future is hybrid i.e. humans who know how to code, how to write and how to collaborate with technology.\n\nJust like a peanut butter and jelly sandwich, the future of software application development appears to be an amalgam of two very appealing ingredients. Oh… and before you ask, creamy with grape, obviously right?','\n',char(10)),'published',NULL,'2025-08-05T10:06:11.275981+00:00',2,'2025-08-04 16:10:49',NULL,'rss',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL);

Following the company’s huge Pixel 8 Pro price drop, and giving away 12 months of Google AI Pro to Pixel 9 owners, Google is back with one last discount before the Pixel 10 lands. This is the company’s deepest discount for the Pixel 9 series yet. There will almost certainly be more after the Pixel 10 officially launches this month, but I don’t see Google dropping the price by much more until next year. With that said, I wouldn’t be surprised if we saw more aggressive trade-in deals, like June’s promotion that paid out hundreds of dollars for years-old phones. Here are Google UK’s current Pixel 9 deals. - Pixel 9 - £549 ($731), £250 off ($332.88) - Pixel 9a - £429 ($571.22), £70 off ($93.21) - Pixel 9 Pro - £679 ($904.09), £320 off ($426.08) - Pixel 9 Pro XL - £799 ($1063.87), £300 off ($399.45) - Pixel 9 Pro Fold - £1,399 ($1862.78), 350 off ($466.03) The star of the show here is the Pixel 9 Pro, which is down to £679 ($904.09). That is a solid price for Google’s most powerful handset (the Pro XL has a bigger screen and battery, but the same ‘pro’ camera features). To quickly compare, Samsung’s Galaxy S25 Ultra costs over £400 more (£1099 / $1463) even with the company’s current £150 ($199.73) discount. Apple’s iPhone 16 Pro remains, predictably, resolutely, at its full $999 price. Don’t forget that the Pixel 9 Pro comes with one year of Google AI Pro for free. Google One subscribers also get 10% of the purchase back as store credit. It’s not just Pixel phones, Google has also discounted the Pixel Buds Pro 2 by £30 ($39.95) (down to £189 / $251.65) and the Pixel Watch 3 by £100 ($133.15) (down to £249 / $331.54). That depends on how patient you are. Google is promising an "exclusive offer” to people who sign up for marketing emails. I’d guess this is a free accessory or subscription for people who pre-order the phone. But even with pre-order deals, these phones will dramatically drop in price soon after their launch. Google has run some form of deal for its flagship Pixel phone almost every month since the Pixel 8. The price drops grow the further away the device is from its launch, as you can see with this Pixel 9 deal. Those discounts will start as early as October, especially as Samsung prepares to launch its Galaxy S25 FE and Apple’s iPhone 17 lands.','published',NULL,'2025-08-05T10:18:31.847303+00:00',2,'2025-08-04 16:10:49',NULL,'rss',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL);

Google DeepMind and Kaggle are introducing the Kaggle Game Arena, a public AI benchmarking platform where AI models compete in strategic games. Watch the chess exhibition matches on August 5 at 10:30 a.m. Pacific Time and look for more tournaments in the future.\n\nCurrent AI benchmarks are struggling to keep pace with modern models. As helpful as they are to measure model performance on specific tasks, it can be hard to know if models trained on internet data are actually solving problems or just remembering answers they''ve already seen. As models reach closer to 100% on certain benchmarks, they also become less effective at revealing meaningful performance differences. We continue to invest in new and more challenging benchmarks, but on the path to general intelligence, we need to continue to look for new ways to evaluate. The more recent shift towards dynamic, human-judged testing solves these issues of memorization and saturation, but in turn, creates new difficulties stemming from the inherent subjectivity of human preferences.\n\nWhile we continue to evolve and pursue current AI benchmarks, we’re also consistently looking to test new approaches to evaluating models. That’s why today, we''re introducing the Kaggle Game Arena: a new, public AI benchmarking platform where AI models compete head-to-head in strategic games, providing a verifiable, and dynamic measure of their capabilities.\n\nGames provide a clear, unambiguous signal of success. Their structured nature and measurable outcomes make them the perfect testbed for evaluating models and agents. They force models to demonstrate many skills including strategic reasoning, long-term planning and dynamic adaptation against an intelligent opponent, providing a robust signal of their general problem-solving intelligence. The value of games as a benchmark is further enhanced by their scalability—difficulty increases with the opponent''s intelligence—and by our ability to inspect and visualize a model''s "reasoning," which offers a glimpse into its strategic thought process.\n\nSpecialized engines like Stockfish and general game playing AI models like AlphaZero have been able to play games at a superhuman level for many years and would beat every frontier model without a doubt. Today’s large language models, however, are not built to specialize in any specific games, and as a result they do not play them nearly as well. While the immediate challenge for the models is to close this gap, in the long-term we would hope for them to achieve a level of play beyond what is currently possible. And with an endlessly increasing set of novel environments we can continue to challenge them even further.\n\nGame Arena is built on Kaggle to provide a fair, standardized environment for model evaluation. For transparency, game harnesses — the frameworks that connect each AI model to the game environment and enforce the rules — as well as the game environments are all open-sourced. Final rankings are determined by a rigorous all-play-all system, where an extensive number of matches between each model pair ensures a statistically robust result.\n\nGoogle DeepMind has long used games as a benchmark, from Atari to AlphaGo and AlphaStar, to demonstrate complex AI capabilities. By testing these models in a competitive arena, we can establish a clear baseline for their strategic reasoning and track progress. The goal is to build an ever-expanding benchmark that grows in difficulty as models face tougher competition. Over time, this could lead to novel strategies, much like AlphaGo''s famous and creative “Move 37” that baffled human experts. The ability to plan, adapt and reason under pressure in a game is analogous to the thinking needed to solve complex challenges in science and business.\n\nOn August 5 at 10:30 a.m. Pacific Time, join us for a special chess exhibition where eight frontier models will face off in a single elimination showdown. We selected a sample from the matches for this exhibition. Hosted by the world''s best chess experts, this event is the premiere demonstration of the Game Arena methodology.\n\nWhile the fun exhibition matches are in a tournament format, the final leaderboard rankings will be determined by the all-play-all system and released after the exhibition. This more extensive method runs over a hundred matches between every pair of models to ensure a statistically robust and definitive measure of performance. You can find more details and how to watch the games at kaggle.com/game-arena.\n\nThis is only the beginning. Our vision for the Game Arena extends far beyond a single game. Kaggle will soon expand Game Arena with new challenges, starting with classics like Go and poker. These games, along with future additions like video games, are excellent tests of AI’s ability to perform long-horizon planning and reasoning, helping us create a comprehensive and ever-evolving benchmark for AI. We’re committed to continuously adding new models and harnesses to the mix, pushing the boundaries of what AI models can achieve. For more details about the Game Arena and the inaugural chess exhibition tournament, see Kaggle’s blog post.','\n',char(10)),'published',NULL,'2025-08-05T10:19:18.551977+00:00',8,'2025-08-04 16:10:49',NULL,'rss',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL);

Initial reviews for these agents have been mixed at best, though, because they struggle to interact with all the different components of our digital lives.\n\nPart of the problem is that we are still building the necessary infrastructure to help agents navigate the world. If we want agents to complete tasks for us, we need to give them the necessary tools while also making sure they use that power responsibly.\n\nAnthropic and Google are among the companies and groups working on exactly that. Over the past year, they have both introduced protocols that try to define how AI agents should interact with each other and the world around them. These protocols could make it easier for agents to control other programs like email clients and note-taking apps.\n\nThe reason has to do with application programming interfaces, the connections between computers or programs that govern much of our online world. APIs currently reply to “pings” with standardized information. But AI models aren’t made to work exactly the same every time. The very randomness that helps them come across as conversational and expressive also makes it difficult for them to both call an API and understand the response.\n\n“Models speak a natural language,” says Theo Chu, a project manager at Anthropic. “For [a model] to get context and do something with that context, there is a translation layer that has to happen for it to make sense to the model.” Chu works on one such translation technique, the Model Context Protocol (MCP), which Anthropic introduced at the end of last year.\n\nMCP attempts to standardize how AI agents interact with the world via various programs, and it’s already very popular. One web aggregator for MCP servers (essentially, the portals for different programs or tools that agents can access) lists over 15,000 servers already.\n\nWorking out how to govern how AI agents interact with each other is arguably an even steeper challenge, and it’s one the Agent2Agent protocol (A2A), introduced by Google in April, tries to take on. Whereas MCP translates requests between words and code, A2A tries to moderate exchanges between agents, which is an “essential next step for the industry to move beyond single-purpose agents,” Rao Surapaneni, who works with A2A at Google Cloud, wrote in an email to MIT Technology Review.\n\nGoogle says 150 companies have already partnered with it to develop and adopt A2A, including Adobe and Salesforce. At a high level, both MCP and A2A tell an AI agent what it absolutely needs to do, what it should do, and what it should not do to ensure a safe interaction with other services. In a way, they are complementary—each agent in an A2A interaction could individually be using MCP to fetch information the other asks for.\n\nHowever, Chu stresses that it is “definitely still early days” for MCP, and the A2A road map lists plenty of tasks still to be done. We’ve identified the three main areas of growth for MCP, A2A, and other agent protocols: security, openness, and efficiency.\n\n### What should these protocols say about security?\n\nResearchers and developers still don’t really understand how AI models work, and new vulnerabilities are being discovered all the time. For chatbot-style AI applications, malicious attacks can cause models to do all sorts of bad things, including regurgitating training data and spouting slurs. But for AI agents, which interact with the world on someone’s behalf, the possibilities are far riskier.\n\nFor example, one AI agent, made to read and send emails for someone, has already been shown to be vulnerable to what’s known as an indirect prompt injection attack. Essentially, an email could be written in a way that hijacks the AI model and causes it to malfunction. Then, if that agent has access to the user’s files, it could be instructed to send private documents to the attacker.\n\nSome researchers believe that protocols like MCP should prevent agents from carrying out harmful actions like this. However, it does not at the moment. “Basically, it does not have any security design,” says Zhaorun Chen, a University of Chicago PhD student who works on AI agent security and uses MCP servers.\n\nBruce Schneier, a security researcher and activist, is skeptical that protocols like MCP will be able to do much to reduce the inherent risks that come with AI and is concerned that giving such technology more power will just give it more ability to cause harm in the real, physical world. “We just don’t have good answers on how to secure this stuff,” says Schneier. “It’s going to be a security cesspool really fast.”\n\nOthers are more hopeful. Security design could be added to MCP and A2A similar to the way it is for internet protocols like HTTPS (though the nature of attacks on AI systems is very different). And Chen and Anthropic believe that standardizing protocols like MCP and A2A can help make it easier to catch and resolve security issues even as is. Chen uses MCP in his research to test the roles different programs can play in attacks to better understand vulnerabilities. Chu at Anthropic believes that these tools could let cybersecurity companies more easily deal with attacks against agents, because it will be easier to unpack who sent what.\n\n### How open should these protocols be?\n\nAlthough MCP and A2A are two of the most popular agent protocols available today, there are plenty of others in the works. Large companies like Cisco and IBM are working on their own protocols, and other groups have put forth different designs like Agora, designed by researchers at the University of Oxford, which upgrades an agent-service communication from human language to structured data in real time.\n\nMany developers hope there could eventually be a registry of safe, trusted systems to navigate the proliferation of agents and tools. Others, including Chen, want users to be able to rate different services in something like a Yelp for AI agent tools. Some more niche protocols have even built blockchains on top of MCP and A2A so that servers can show they are not just spam.\n\nBoth MCP and A2A are open-source, which is common for would-be standards as it lets others work on building them. This can help protocols develop faster and more transparently.\n\n“If we go build something together, we spend less time overall, because we’re not having to each reinvent the wheel,” says David Nalley, who leads developer experience at Amazon Web Services and works with a lot of open-source systems, including A2A and MCP.\n\nNalley oversaw Google’s donation of A2A to the Linux Foundation, a nonprofit organization that guides open-source projects, back in June. With the foundation’s stewardship, the developers who work on A2A (including employees at Google and many others) all get a say in how it should evolve. MCP, on the other hand, is owned by Anthropic and licensed for free. That is a sticking point for some open-source advocates, who want others to have a say in how the code base itself is developed.\n\n“There’s admittedly some increased risk around a single person or a single entity being in absolute control,” says Nalley. He says most people would prefer multiple groups to have a “seat at the table” to make sure that these protocols are serving everyone’s best interests.\n\nHowever, Nalley does believe Anthropic is acting in good faith—its license, he says, is incredibly permissive, allowing other groups to create their own modified versions of the code (a process known as “forking”).\n\n“Someone could fork it if they needed to, if something went completely off the rails,” says Nalley. IBM’s Agent Communication Protocol was actually spun off of MCP.\n\n### Is natural language fast enough?\n\nMCP and A2A work on the agents’ terms—they use words and phrases (termed natural language in AI), just as AI models do when they are responding to a person. This is part of the selling point for these protocols, because it means the model doesn’t have to be trained to talk in a way that is unnatural to it. “Allowing a natural-language interface to be used between agents and not just with humans unlocks sharing the intelligence that is built into these agents,” says Surapaneni.\n\nBut this choice does come with drawbacks. Natural-language interfaces lack the precision of APIs, and that could result in incorrect responses. And it creates inefficiencies.\n\nUsually, an AI model reads and responds to text by splitting words into tokens. The AI model will read a prompt, split it into input tokens, generate a response in the form of output tokens, and then put these tokens into words to send back. These tokens define in some sense how much work the AI model has to do—that’s why most AI platforms charge users according to the number of tokens used.\n\nBut the whole point of working in tokens is so that people can understand the output—it’s usually faster and more efficient for machine-to-machine communication to just work over code. MCP and A2A both work in natural language, so they require the model to spend tokens as the agent talks to other machines, like tools and other agents. The user never even sees these exchanges—all the effort of making everything human-readable doesn’t ever get read by a human. “You waste a lot of tokens if you want to use MCP,” says Chen.\n\nChen describes this process as potentially very costly. For example, suppose the user wants the agent to read a document and summarize it. If the agent uses another program to summarize here, it needs to read the document, write the document to the program, read back the summary, and write it back to the user. Since the agent needed to read and write everything, both the document and the summary get doubled up. According to Chen, “It’s actually a lot of tokens.”\n\nAs with so many aspects of MCP and A2A’s designs, their benefits also create new challenges. “There’s a long way to go if we want to scale up and actually make them useful,” says Chen.','\n',char(10)),'published',NULL,'2025-08-05T13:23:55.243284+00:00',6,'2025-08-04 16:10:51',NULL,'rss',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL);

But I think that’s the wrong question. A better one is: How is AI going to fundamentally change my job?\n\nI’ve been thinking about that a lot lately, especially as I spend more time working with AI. As a writing partner. As a thought partner.\n\nWhen I step back, AI reminds me of an intern: fast, eager, highly educated, and ready to help however it can. And if you give it clear instructions, it can be surprisingly helpful.\n\nBut just like an intern, its enthusiasm sometimes outpaces its ability. It’ll take a confident swing … and confidently miss. That’s where humans come in.\n\n## **What’s your agentic AI strategy?**\n\nOur playbook is your free guide to becoming an agentic enterprise. Learn about use cases, deployment, and AI skills, and download interactive worksheets for your team.\n\n[The future starts now](https://www.salesforce.com/blog/playbook/agentic-ai)\n\n![](https://www.salesforce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/07/offer.png?w=458)\n\n## The next big shift: Learning to work with AI\n\nSuccess with AI isn’t simply using a tool; it’s guiding the work. We set the direction of a task, define what “good” looks like, review the output, and shape what comes next. In short, we’re managing AI. And that’s a big shift, especially if you’re used to doing it all yourself.\n\nHere’s a quick example. Let’s say I’m working on something creative: messaging, naming, design concepts. I’ll ask the AI for 50 variations. Then I’ll pick a few I like, give feedback, and go another round. It’s fast and iterative, but I still need to know what’s working and why. That judgment, that taste? That’s the human part.\n\nAnd this is where context really matters. Good managers don’t just assign tasks, they give context and pass-downs. They explain: Here’s what we’re trying to do. Here’s why it matters. Here’s what good looks like. That clarity turns a task into a shared goal.\n\nWorking with AI is no different. Without the right context or feedback, AI is just guessing.\n\nBut when you do provide it — when you guide the AI with the same clarity and intent as you might do with an employee — you get much more back. Because great managers aren’t just organizers. They’re multipliers. They amplify what their teams can do. And it’s the same with AI. The best managers will get 10x better results from AI just by knowing how to guide it well.\n\n## Managing outcomes is part of everyone’s job\n\nThere’s also an opportunity here to grow your own skills. Because when you have to explain what good looks like — when you have to guide someone (or something) else through the work — you start to understand it more deeply yourself. Teaching is often the best way to learn. So, in a way, managing the work doesn’t just make you more productive. It makes you better.\n\nOr imagine a junior marketer kicking off a big campaign. They meet with stakeholders, align on goals, and pull together what the AI needs: brand guidelines, a few past campaigns that hit the mark, maybe even a mood board to set the tone. Then they hand it off to an AI agent, asking for a draft brief, supporting research, and headline ideas. The AI gets to work. But it’s the marketer who reviews the output, sharpens the story, and shapes it into something that works. That’s not just doing the task. That’s managing the work.\n\nAnd that’s the shift. For a long time, “managing” was something you did after a promotion, once you had the title. But not anymore. In a world where AI is doing more of the work, managing outcomes is part of everyone’s job. Honestly, I think we need a Manager 101 course in college or trade school — not for managing people, but for managing work, tools, and results when AI is part of the team.\n\nOr maybe you’re someone who loves being in the work: writing, designing, building. That doesn’t have to change. But with AI in the mix, you have a helper now: fast, tireless, eager, and in need of direction. So, it’s no longer just about doing the task. It’s about guiding the work and shaping the outcome.\n\nAnd as the guide, you stay in control of the creative direction. The insight, the judgment, the context: That’s what makes the work good. And it’s exactly what AI needs from you. In return, it helps you move faster, explore more, and spend more time on what matters most.\n\n## How do you start?\n\nTreat AI like a teammate. Give it context. Set the direction. Define what good looks like. Then review, refine, repeat.\n\nWant to lead in the age of AI? Learn to manage the work. The title can come later.\n\nSo the real question isn’t whether AI will take your job. It’s whether you’re ready to lead the work in a whole new way.','\n',char(10)),'completed',NULL,'2025-08-05T13:56:41.321393+00:00',19,'2025-08-04 16:10:51',NULL,'rss',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL);

Это то, что нам нужно взять».</p><p>Кук отметил, что Apple редко бывает первой на рынке — не с ПК, не со смартфонами — но часто определяет стандарты для того, что будет дальше. «Так я чувствую и про ИИ», — сказал он.</p><p>За последний год Apple наняла 12 000 новых сотрудников, 40% из которых присоединились к исследованиям и разработкам. Глава отдела программного обеспечения Крэйг Федериги сообщил сотрудникам, что Apple полностью перестраивает Siri на единой архитектуре, новая версия ожидается в 2026 году. Apple также разрабатывает собственные чипы ИИ и строит новый дата-центр в Хьюстоне.</p><p>Apple планирует увеличить расходы на искусственный интеллект и принять более открытый подход к приобретениям, поскольку сталкивается с растущим давлением со стороны конкурентов и серьёзными внутренними проблемами. Во время последнего отчётного звонка генеральный директор Apple Тим Кук объявил, что компания значительно больше инвестирует в ИИ. Финансовый директор Apple Кеван Парех добавил, что большая часть текущего роста расходов компании связана с увеличением инвестиций в ИИ.</p><p>Внутри компании Apple переводит сотрудников на проекты, ориентированные на ИИ, стремясь интегрировать функции ИИ на всех своих платформах. Основное внимание, по словам компании, уделяется созданию персонализированного, ориентированного на конфиденциальность и бесшовного пользовательского опыта. Для инфраструктуры Apple полагается на серверы, работающие на собственных чипах под названием «Private Cloud Compute», а не на оборудование от поставщиков, таких как Nvidia. В отличие от Google или Microsoft, Apple не управляет собственной облачной инфраструктурой, вместо этого используя гибридную модель с партнёрскими решениями, которые учитываются как операционные расходы.</p><p>Кук также заявил, что Apple открыта для приобретений любого размера, если они поддерживают её стратегию в области ИИ. С начала этого года Apple приобрела около семи компаний, в основном небольших фирм, не все из которых связаны с ИИ. Самым крупным приобретением Apple на сегодняшний день стала покупка Beats Electronics за 3 миллиарда долларов в 2014 году.</p><p>Несмотря на увеличение расходов, Apple остаётся консервативной по сравнению с другими технологическими гигантами. Компания инвестировала 3,46 миллиарда долларов в капитальные расходы в июньском квартале, в то время как Google, Meta и Microsoft планируют потратить десятки миллиардов каждый. Кук также отмахнулся от опасений, что новые устройства с ИИ могут заменить iPhone, описав их как дополняющие, а не конкурирующие.</p><p>Заявление Apple прозвучало на фоне серьёзных внутренних проблем. Отчёты указывают на технические неудачи и дисфункциональное управление, которые задержали выпуск обновлённых функций Siri до 2026 года. Борьба за власть между группой ИИ Джона Джаннандреа и командой программного обеспечения Крэйга Федериги, по сообщениям, затормозила разработку, что привело к перестановкам, в результате которых Федериги возглавил Siri. Apple также столкнулась с серьёзной нехваткой вычислительных мощностей, что вынудило её отказаться от долгосрочной стратегии обработки данных на устройстве.</p><p>Эти проблемы вызвали массовый отток талантов, Meta переманила нескольких ключевых исследователей ИИ многомиллионными контрактами. В результате Apple, по сообщениям, рассматривает серьёзный стратегический сдвиг, включая переговоры с OpenAI и Anthropic об использовании их моделей для Siri. Под руководством Федериги Apple, как говорят, открыта для интеграции моделей с открытым исходным кодом, если они превосходят её собственные разработки. Новые инвестиции и более гибкая стратегия приобретений, по-видимому, являются ответом Apple на заполнение как стратегических, так и кадровых пробелов.</p>','Тим Кук назвал ИИ переломным моментом уровня интернета или смартфона.

Главное нововведение — «Harmonize», усовершенствованная версия экспериментального «Project Perfect Blend». Инструмент автоматически подбирает цвет, освещение, тени и общую атмосферу новых элементов изображения для их бесшовного встраивания в существующие фото. В Adobe отмечают, что раньше создание правдоподобных коллажей требовало глубоких знаний редактора, тогда как теперь пользователи могут выбирать из трёх вариантов композиции для наиболее естественного вида. «Harmonize» доступен в бета-версии для веб- и десктоп-Photoshop, а также в раннем доступе на iOS.</p><p>Параллельно компания запустила AI-функцию апскейлинга, повышающую разрешение снимков до 8 мегапикселей без потери качества — решение для реставрации старых фото и адаптации контента под разные платформы. Улучшено и удаление объектов: алгоритм оставляет меньше артефактов фона и реалистичнее заполняет удалённые области. Обе функции уже работают в веб- и десктоп-бете. Пользователи также получили выбор между моделями Firefly Image 1 и Image 3 в инструментах «Generative Fill» и «Generative Expand», что позволяет тонче управлять стилистикой. Причины отсутствия Firefly Image 2 не раскрываются.</p><p>Новшества вновь поднимают вопросы подлинности изображений. Хотя в Photoshop есть ограничения на создание дипфейков публичных лиц или насильственного контента, «Harmonize» позволяет комбинировать почти любые объекты при наличии исходников. Раньше подобные манипуляции требовали мастерства, теперь же они сводятся к нескольким кликам, упрощая масштабирование сложного редактирования. Это делает критически важным отслеживание изменений. В качестве решения Adobe предлагает систему Content Credentials, фиксирующую правки для создания цепочки доверия. Как пояснил менеджер продукта Джоэл Баер изданию The Verge, пользователи также обязаны соблюдать условия сервиса, запрещающие нелегальный или вредоносный контент. Революция в инструментах редактирования неизбежно меняет ландшафт цифрового творчества, но и обнажает его уязвимости — теперь даже новички могут создавать гиперреалистичные иллюзии, а значит, прозрачность и этика обработки становятся не техническим нюансом, а общественным императивом.</p>','Adobe выпустила новые AI-инструменты для Photoshop, включая Harmonize, которые автоматизируют сложное редактирование: подгонку света, цвета и удаление объектов.

Устройство отличается от традиционных петличных комплектов вроде RØDE или Shure. Magic имеет модульную конструкцию, легко адаптируясь к записи в условиях, где обычные системы бессильны.</p><p>Концепция напоминает Sennheiser Profile: микрофон работает и как петличка, и как ручной интервью-микрофон. Толщина — всего 13 мм, каждый из двух передатчиков весит 7 г. Они переключаются между режимами: петличный, ручной, настольный и камерный. Дальность — до 100 метров, а заряда батареи хватает на 6 часов.</p><p>Это третья новинка BOYA в году после BOYAMIC 2 (высококачественный звукозапись) и BOYALINK 3 (повседневная съёмка). Все три используют ИИ-архитектуру для акустической обработки. Magic применяет ту же технологию, предлагая гибкость под разные стили съёмки.</p><p>Современный контент-мейкинг стал текучим: интервью, влоги, стримы и озвучка часто совмещаются в одном workflow. Но оборудование остаётся фрагментированным, создавая трение. BOYA Magic — ответ на этот тренд: вместо набора микрофонов он объединяет 4 конфигурации в карманном устройстве.</p><p>Два передатчика хранятся в компактном кейсе для зарядки. При работе в настольном/камерном режиме они подключаются к ресиверу внутри кейса. Несмотря на размеры, кейс содержит два ресивера: для смартфона (USB-C/Lightning) и для камеры/рекордера. Запись ведётся в 48кГц/24-бит с динамическим диапазоном 144 дБ.</p><p>BOYA Magic использует ИИ-фильтрацию шумов, обученную на 700 000 аудиосэмплов. Система включает смарт-лимитер для защиты от клиппинга и запись дубля (-12dB). Устройство автоматически включается при извлечении из кейса с настройками по умолчанию. Для ускорения работы кейсом можно управлять кнопкой — этот дизайн патентуется.</p><p>Для кастомизации есть приложение BOYA Central с эквалайзером и режимами шумоподавления. Это удобно для мобильных авторов или команд, где громоздкое оборудование замедляет съёмку.</p><p>Magic использует аудиоядро от BOYAMIC 2/BOYALINK 3, но в более гибком корпусе. По словам компании, это снижает избыточность оборудования и упрощает запись качественного звука.</p><p>Приживётся ли такой подход — вопрос. Но для тех, кто снимает в движении, на локациях или в стримах, Magic может стать символом перехода к лёгким и адаптивным решениям.

BestColleges.com даже запустил трекер закрытий и слияний университетов. Парадоксально, но Gallup фиксирует рост доверия к высшему образованию впервые за десятилетия — среди выпускников, людей без дипломов, демократов и республиканцев.</p><p>Однако доверие не покрывает растущих расходов на ключевые услуги, особенно психическое здоровье студентов. Решение пришло через инновацию: консорциум MCC (MINDful College Connections), объединивший DePauw University, Rose-Hulman и другие вузы. Исполнительный директор доктор Кёртис Уайзли объясняет: «Индивидуально университеты не справлялись с запросом на wellbeing-услуги. Совместно мы создали устойчивую модель, экономя средства за счёт масштаба».</p><p>MCC — некоммерческая организация с внешним финансированием. Каждый участник получает доступ к штатному психологу и педагогу по ментальному здоровью. Операционный комитет, куда входят руководители служб вузов, распределяет ресурсы в пиковые моменты: например, при проведении Недели осведомлённости или критических инцидентах специалисты оперативно перебрасываются между кампусами.</p><p>Консорциум также договаривается о скидках на электронные медкарты, телетерапию и онлайн-поддержку.

Prompt engineering (искусство формулировок для ИИ) уступает место «контекстному инжинирингу», требующему глубокого понимания подсистем. Например, DSPy сочетает код с промптами, а Natural Programming от WSO2 позволяет встраивать естественные выражения в языки программирования. Уровень абстракции растет: логика программ теперь сплетает код, текст, изображения и звук. Как в многоязычной культуре, мы выбираем инструмент под задачу — так рождаются «мультиязычные артефакты» из прозы и кода.</p><h3>Уроки бутерброда</h3><p>Халаф провела эксперимент в нью-йоркской школе: студенты писали инструкции для сэндвича с арахисовой пастой. Результат? Хаос, демонстрирующий разрыв между замыслом и исполнением. Она цитирует Эдсгера Дейкстру, пионера computer science: «Естественность языка — в легкости порождать незаметный бред». Математика (или код) точнее слов для алгоритмов. Программисты не спешат доверять генеративному ИИ сложные задачи, но для анализа текста или вопросов по базе знаний он идеален. Вывод: будущее — в гибридных системах, где код дополняется прозой.</p><h3>Иллюзия беглости</h3><p>Создание программ без понимания кода порождает «иллюзию беглости». Можно собрать работающее приложение, но при необходимости исправить ошибку или оптимизировать систему автор окажется в тупике. Халаф ссылается на Raspberry Pi Foundation: программирование учит «цифровому агентству» — способности влиять на цифровой мир, а не только потреблять. Это включает декомпозицию проблем и точность формулировок.</p><p>«Вычислительное мышление — навык жизни, основа системного подхода, — резюмирует Халаф. — ИИ станет неотъемлемой частью ПО, как данные и API. Будущий инженер будет и разработчиком, и специалистом по ИИ. Но это требует редкого сочетания: беглости в коде и тексте. Технари часто слабы в письме, гуманитарии боятся кода. Университеты уже рассматривают интеграцию computer science в программы liberal arts». ИИ не упраздняет программирование, а переосмысливает его, требуя не слепой веры в «волшебные промпты», а синтеза логики и языковой чуткости. Как в истории с бутербродом: без четких инструкций даже простое действие превращается в хаос. Революция ИИ открыла двери для миллионов, но фундаментальные принципы вычислений остаются компасом в этом новом мире. Умение мыслить системно, а не просто генерировать код по запросу, станет ключевым дифференциатором. Ирония в том, что чем «умнее» становятся инструменты, тем важнее человеческое понимание того, как они работают — иначе мы рискуем получить поколение «цифровых иллюзионистов», мастеров поверхностных решений без глубины.</p>','Эксперты спорят: заменит ли генеративный ИИ классическое программирование?

После недавнего снижения цен на Pixel 8 Pro и бесплатной годовой подписки на Google AI Pro для владельцев Pixel 9, компания представляет рекордные скидки на текущие флагманы. Эксперты прогнозируют дальнейшее снижение после релиза Pixel 10 в этом месяце, но столь глубокие уценки вряд ли повторятся до следующего года. Возможно, Google усилит программу trade-in, как в июне, когда принимали старые смартфоны за сотни долларов.</p><p>Актуальные цены в Великобритании с конвертацией в доллары:</p><ul><li>Pixel 9: $731 (скидка $332)</li><li>Pixel 9a: $571 (скидка $93)</li><li><strong>Pixel 9 Pro: $904 (скидка $426)</strong></li><li>Pixel 9 Pro XL: $1063 (скидка $399)</li><li>Pixel 9 Pro Fold: $1862 (скидка $466)</li></ul><p>Особенно привлекателен Pixel 9 Pro за $904 — это мощнейший смартфон Google с идентичной Pro XL камерой. Для сравнения: Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra даже со скидкой $200 стоит $1463, а iPhone 16 Pro сохраняет цену $999. Все модели Pixel 9 Pro включают годовой доступ к Google AI Pro, а подписчики Google One получают 10% кэшбэка. Скидки также распространяются на Pixel Buds Pro 2 ($252, минус $40) и Pixel Watch 3 ($332, минус $133). Ожидается, что Google предложит «эксклюзивные условия» предзаказа через email-рассылку, но исторически самые выгодные цены появляются через 2-3 месяца после релиза — как сейчас с Pixel 9. Тренд продолжится осенью на фоне анонсов Galaxy S25 FE и iPhone 17.</p><p>Такие распродажи — классический манёвр перед выходом новых флагманов, но редкость для Google. Хотя октябрьские скидки могут быть ещё щедрее, текущее предложение с бесплатной подпиской на AI-сервисы — сильный аргумент для тех, кто ценит не только железо, но и экосистему. Впрочем, учитывая цикличность ценовых войн между Google, Apple и Samsung, самые терпеливые покупатели точно не прогадают.</p>','Google объявил рекордные скидки до $426 на линейку Pixel 9 перед запуском Pixel 10.

Однако первые оценки таких помощников скептичны — они плохо взаимодействуют с разношёрстными компонентами нашей цифровой жизни.</p><p>Часть проблемы — отсутствие инфраструктуры для навигации агентов в мире. Чтобы они выполняли задачи, нужны инструменты, но с гарантиями ответственного использования. Этим заняты Anthropic и Google, представившие за год протоколы, определяющие взаимодействие агентов между собой и окружением. Такие стандарты упростят управление почтовыми клиентами или блокнотами.</p><p>Ключ — в API (интерфейсах прикладного программирования), связующих компьютеры и программы. API отвечают на запросы стандартизированно, но ИИ-модели работают стохастично. Их «разговорчивость» мешает чётко вызывать API и понимать ответы. «Модели оперируют естественным языком, — поясняет Тео Чу, менеджер проектов Anthropic. — Для действий на основе контекста нужен слой перевода». Чу разрабатывает Model Context Protocol (MCP), представленный в конце прошлого года.</p><p>MCP стандартизирует взаимодействие агентов с программами и уже популярен: агрегатор серверов MCP насчитывает 15 000 порталов. Сложнее управлять коммуникацией между агентами — эту задачу решает протокол Agent2Agent (A2A) от Google. Если MCP переводит слова в код, то A2A модерирует диалоги агентов. «Это следующий шаг для перехода от узкоспециализированных агентов», — отмечает Рао Сурапамени из Google Cloud. В проекте участвуют 150 компаний, включая Adobe.</p><p>Оба протокола задают правила: что агент обязан, может и не должен делать для безопасности. Они дополняют друг друга: агенты в A2A могут использовать MCP для обмена данными. Но Чу подчёркивает: «MCP ещё в зачаточном состоянии», а в дорожной карте A2A много незавершённых задач. Ключевые направления развития — безопасность, открытость и эффективность.</p><p><strong>Безопасность:</strong> Уязвимости ИИ-моделей открывают ежедневно. Для агентов, действующих от имени пользователя, риски катастрофичны. Уже известны атаки через инъекцию промптов: письмо может «взломать» агента и заставить отправить конфиденциальные файлы. «MCP пока не имеет защиты», — констатирует Чжаорун Чэнь, исследователь безопасности из Чикагского университета. Эксперт Брюс Шнайер пессимистичен: «Мы не знаем, как защитить это. Это станет болотом уязвимостей». Оптимисты верят, что стандартизация упростит обнаружение угроз, как в HTTPS.</p><p><strong>Открытость:</strong> MCP и A2A — open-source, что ускоряет развитие. Amazon Web Services поддерживает коллаборацию: «Не надо изобретать велосипед». Google передал A2A Linux Foundation для коллективного управления. MCP остаётся под контролем Anthropic, хотя и с либеральной лицензией, разрешающей форки (как в случае с протоколом IBM). «Контроль одной компанией рискован», — отмечает Дэвид Налли из AWS, но доверяет добросовестности Anthropic.</p><p><strong>Эффективность:</strong> MCP и A2A используют естественный язык, но вопрос скорости остаётся открытым. Альтернативы вроде Agora от Оксфорда переводят общение в структурированные данные в реальном времени. Разработчики мечтают о реестре доверенных инструментов и «Yelp для ИИ-сервисов», а нишевые протоколы внедряют блокчейн для верификации.</p><p>Пока MCP и A2A — лишь первые кирпичи в фундаменте будущего, где ИИ-агенты станут полноценными помощниками. Их успех зависит от решения трёх головоломок: как обеспечить безопасность без паранойи, открытость без хаоса и скорость без потери гибкости. Отрасль делает ставку на стандарты, но предстоит доказать, что протоколы не станут прокрустовым ложем для творческого потенциала ИИ.</p>','Anthropic и Google создают протоколы MCP и A2A, чтобы ИИ-агенты могли управлять программами и общаться между собой.
