The more human-like LLMs become, the more we risk misunderstanding them.


In our new paper, [@lujainmibrahim](https://twitter.com/lujainmibrahim) and I explore how anthropomorphism shapes & limits LLM research. We analyze 200k+ research articles, identify 5 key assumptions, and outline emerging alternatives 🧵
