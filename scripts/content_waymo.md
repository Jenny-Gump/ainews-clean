## Advancing Vision Zero: Waymo’s Research on Speed and Seatbelt Safety Impact



The Waymo Team





At Waymo, our goal is to make streets safer for everyone – and our strong safety record reflects that commitment. From 360-degree perception to advanced collision avoidance, many factors contribute to how we help reduce crashes on public roads. But some of the most impactful safety measures are also the simplest – such as consistently obeying speed limits, ensuring seatbelt use, and driving the safest vehicles. Today, we’re sharing two new research papers that demonstrate how these fundamental practices can help move us closer to the Vision Zero goal of eliminating traffic fatalities and severe injuries.

## New Insights for Scaling Laws in Autonomous Driving



The Waymo Team





Many recent AI breakthroughs have followed a common pattern: bigger models, trained on more data, with more compute, often deliver extraordinary gains. Waymo’s latest study explores whether this trend extends to autonomous driving and establishes new scaling laws in motion planning and forecasting — core autonomous vehicle (AV) capabilities.

## New Study: Waymo is reducing serious crashes and making streets safer for those most at risk



The Waymo Team





The path to Vision Zero requires reducing severe crashes and improving the safety of those most at risk. Our latest research paper shows that the Waymo Driver is making significant strides in both areas. By reducing the most dangerous crashes and providing better protection for pedestrians, cyclists, and other vulnerable road users, Waymo is making streets safer in cities where it operates.
